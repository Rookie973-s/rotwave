00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,540
They hacked into our system
Observations. Well, without the eye of God, we

178
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,820
We can't catch bandits.

179
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,300
Before the creation of all these technologies like
In general, the police worked, right?

180
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,720
My mistake.

181
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,540
Next time I'll catch them. Even if
This time it will be, apparently

182
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,360
All our movements. And here's the question.

183
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,780
Do what? They can. Why can't they
Can we?

184
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
Sorry, sir.

185
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,700
What are the successes of our cyberbolization?

186
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,880
I cast a penetration point, but
The hackers didn't trace it.

187
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,060
Nikki and I haven't run out of--
you.

188
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,740
To capture the cyberbolic, you need experience
hunter.

189
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,320
Do you propose to return them to her?

190
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,120
I know he's your old chef, but now the era
Have you... and exploiting it.

191
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,500
Yes, there are flaws in it and ours
Equipment, but the seasoning is impeccable. You

192
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,880
Spice up from learning on real operations.
Want the phone for yourself

193
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,980
Did it show how to work?

194
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,280
And this fossil will help save us
face. Captain.

195
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,450
I don't care, it's gonna be a mammoth shit or
Spice Gerl.

196
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,350
Find them and remember them.

197
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,810
Thing!

198
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,910
Christmas trees -Fuckers, go -T!

199
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,390
Did you see the file he won?

200
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,990
He is a legend. Solid rewards.

201
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,550
The real champion is the operator. Champion
Hand-to-hand combat.

202
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,950
Five years in a row.

203
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,430
Weapons expert, surveillance,
penetration, intelligence collection. He was

204
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,810
In drug cartels and organized crime.

205
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,350
Restricted, discreet,
communicable.

206
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,010
And a hobby - Making up calls.

207
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,930
The only place in his career--
a major mistake from which he died

208
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,930
partner.

209
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,440
Find which dog will poop first.

210
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,100
Is it true?

211
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,460
Hello. Did you find out?

212
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
No.

213
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,360
All the others are in operational work. So am I
I don't know what.

214
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,700
I'm looking at a pensioner.

215
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,560
Be patient. Can the captain for you
Watching carefully? Maybe we're not ready yet

216
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,800
Operational work? More later.

217
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Are you here at the beginning?

218
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,740
Sorry, are you for me?

219
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,640
Why should you follow me?

220
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,080
You have me confused with someone.

221
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,460
Not following me?

222
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,620
Not next.

223
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,160
Want to?

224
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,800
Didn't you move after me where it turned out
coat?

225
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,170
I'm at another table for you.

226
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,550
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on.

227
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,330
At 2 .43 I saw the lens for the first time. It was
pet store.

228
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,350
Then you followed me 4 hours 17
minutes. You changed your appearance three times.

229
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,870
And he scattered notes nine times.

230
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,510
A colleague helped you on the bus.

231
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,470
Hey, careful. Uh, I'm sorry. Uh, sorry.

232
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,330
That's right, the Zug.

233
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,910
Okay?

234
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,510
Your face kicked you out.

235
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,620
So you remember, Uncle Bon? You're not
I've seen you since I was eight.

236
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,480
I heard you decided to serve and they gave you
Your father's number.

237
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,660
He would be proud.

238
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,940
How did you find out I was at the pet store?

239
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,980
I'll explain, since you ask.

240
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,820
First...

241
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,680
Don't throw notes away. Second, walking
Dogs, retreat, bus boarding, all

242
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,520
Careless. Dog fashion order
Fucking, incorrect. What, stand,

243
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Yanto, fii.

244
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm to blame for not being picked up, otherwise I'd be
I hadn't remembered.

245
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,600
Here you are well done.

246
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,720
You said my coworker on the bus. What
Did you take?

247
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,140
Yes, I see.

248
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,330
It's not your training. You're me
Check.

249
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,330
With this level you are four hours for
M -followed.

250
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,990
Quite arrogant.

251
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,850
Criminal police in Macau.

252
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Hey.

253
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,120
Do you know Padamban?

254
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,380
Long time no see. This is Inspector Uyoley.

255
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Hello.

256
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,140
Come on. Come on. Uh, no.

257
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
You will.

258
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,440
So, why did he double-check me. And this
All you noticed?

259
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,320
So that dead partner was ...

260
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,410
Your dad?

261
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,270
Back.

262
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,770
This is a crime scene video. This
entering the hotel rooms before

263
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,770
The system was broken.

264
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,510
Repeat the last 15 seconds.

265
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,800
Again.

266
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,140
Again.

267
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,600
How did you recognize them? They looked at
Cameras when they're introduced.

268
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,940
So they were there before. They knew where
Chambers. Why did he forget?

269
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,460
He checked if it worked.

270
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,060
The cameras stopped and switched
route.

271
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,200
Right?

272
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Brother?

273
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,020
Darik on a psycho out of a change of plan?

274
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,680
How do you think?

275
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,080
Go calm him down.

276
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,000
The main thing is that all the brothers chose normally.
Well, it's been a day, huh?

277
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Shit, honey.

278
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,260
You almost molested.

279
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,960
We had such a plan.

280
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,750
But we coped.

281
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,850
And they found something from above.

282
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,570
What's up? Solid jambs.

283
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:48,010
In all these years, I've never hit
Rooms. And now the shit is small.

284
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,790
Yes, everything will be fine.

285
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,990
And so are you.

286
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,470
He knows. We can do it again.

287
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,950
Score Score.

288
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,640
Why should I be afraid now?

289
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,260
Unfortunately, but I can hardly explain.

290
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,900
Then I will explain why you should be afraid of you.

291
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Principal!

292
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,520
Sa Van, even you are against me.

293
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,160
Boss, no!

294
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:18,380
For decades, no one took pictures of Haru, but
That shit fucked everything!

295
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,220
Ten billion at stake, calm down.

296
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,060
There's enough for everyone. What ten
billion? Is this cash or what?

297
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,090
This is this drin. This cane has changed
outfit.

298
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,170
You, look, bob, stick.

299
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,430
Remember its characteristics.

300
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,710
These teeth are swinging. Number two.

301
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,850
He found a beech tree with earrings.

302
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,270
True, this is ours.

303
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,350
Call. On screen.

304
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,630
Puppy number two. I see number stick
three.

305
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,990
Not very clear, huh? I got a clear one
frame. Great, well done. Number Fagon

306
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,089
He blocked a mustache.

307
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,590
He found the third. There the sight is there. He
Cracked.

308
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,890
Only he has this piece there.

309
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Ter, it may seem like it, but this
Fourth time ugly. I've already seen this

310
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
coat.

311
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
Someone gave it to him.

312
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Guys, watch out!

313
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
There's another one.

314
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,060
All discoveries on the main screen.

315
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,340
So certainly.

316
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,110
Police. Police. Uh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

317
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,820
You saved me once and my life.

318
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,100
I appreciate this life.

319
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,420
I don't want anything with you
He's getting agitated.

320
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
You got me?

321
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
Yes.

322
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,740
Understood.

323
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,340
You and I are in the coffin together.

324
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,720
I don't intend to die.

325
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,060
I want us all to live in a cage.

326
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,700
Tsuni citizen Boris Boris ISFAI made it
Photo.

327
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,960
This is most likely the fifth accomplice.

328
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,620
Have we been able to identify him?

329
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:09,150
In the late '80s, one was wanted
The killer nicknamed Shadow.

330
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,730
And on the reconnaissance side, he retreated. He
He served in an elite hit squad.

331
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:19,190
During the war, he, working under
Cover, killed military and political men,

332
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,390
Killed with a knife.

333
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,830
And he always left.

334
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,810
Later, in search of wealth, he escaped
Here, he planned more than ten raids

335
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,990
bank. And three times they left the raids while you enter
99 never disappeared.

336
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,260
This is perhaps a shadow.

337
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,640
Is he back from retirement? Yes.

338
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,500
I remember him. What are you doing next?

339
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,120
In such a photo, the face cannot be recognized. We
We will increase search measures and

340
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,440
All of them. Where exactly?

341
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,940
We've got a cab record of his accomplices.

342
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,440
Old town rooms. The area is great.

343
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,480
I propose a two-pronged approach. Search
open. For the distraction from Ain

344
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,379
Follow-up group.

345
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Officer out.

346
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,740
She was dismissed.

347
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:08,580
What? How did you dissolve? With modern
Covering AI rooms, regular groups

348
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,060
It is hardly needed.

349
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,639
I offer people's observation.

350
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,639
You need your most unrecognizable employees,
that they've never seen before.

351
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,500
Officer out, maybe you'll help us
Collect a temporary group?

352
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,360
Such a detachment assembled in Toropi will be
Not particularly efficient.

353
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,500
Hey, Melusga, don't stay outside
Over there.

354
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,610
Detention, reinforced?

355
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,690
Let the girl attract.

356
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,090
I'm afraid that's going to knock it all on the head.

357
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,070
And they will throw again.

358
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,110
You took such a trifle to the police.

359
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:16,590
Yeah, her dad was a cop. She understands
She was taken for the sake of an excessive face.

360
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,670
He can't even smile.

361
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,190
What does it take to be a cop? I deserve it
You belong here. How dare you?

362
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,570
Remember that you morons missed them.

363
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,410
Well, I'm a bandit. Hold me. Come on. Come on.

364
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,030
Surgery, huh? Well, come on.

365
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,760
Come on, damn it, twist it already.

366
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,780
After fighting so respectfully in the department, you can
Losing more life.

367
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:34,750
No one even believes that a woman
Can get out the first door. And what woman

368
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,730
He can catch the first bullet. And what from
Togo?

369
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,270
I'm not afraid.

370
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,010
But they are afraid for you.

371
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,910
My body is none of their business.

372
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,990
But this is the body of their colleague.

373
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,550
Am I a colleague for them?

374
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,450
Old.

375
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,190
Gu -hu grew up.

376
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,070
She is everything in you.

377
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,090
But I see that in the department is unhappy.

378
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,750
Her temperature can make her sick.

379
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,870
Especially in the field.

380
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,150
Stand, Politics!

381
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,870
Well, don't worry, I'll take care of it.

382
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,610
Want 400 bucks?

383
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:49,750
Find the 1xbet website, get a bonus for
registration and bet on any

384
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,490
And now, if you look ...

385
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:11,130
I

386
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,740
I'll take it. Post the detail. Let's get him.

387
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,140
The captain did not step correctly.

388
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,550
Thank you, bye.

389
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,390
You look like a cop.

390
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,430
Thank you, bye.

391
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,110
We're dealing with an old, thieving face
Old School.

392
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,310
Therefore I will teach you to hunt
Old.

393
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,170
Here.

394
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,870
During supervision, develop the habit of all
Steady.

395
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,450
And at first sight.

396
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,810
The main thing is important.

397
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,630
Basic draise only, non -ineven
Features.

398
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,010
My hands are on my belt here.

399
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,870
What fingers are in your pockets?

400
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,490
Left index, middle right.

401
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,490
Detached supervision is one thing. And everyone
Member is his own task.

402
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
He left.

403
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
Who?

404
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,220
Here.

405
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,800
On this day we learn to merge with the crowd.

406
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,480
Immediately in practice.

407
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,260
Dog's head causes a litter. Officer
Luna, what did you say? Dog's head, that

408
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,800
My call sign is. A detachment of beautiful people on
in place.

409
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,990
I will give you all the congratulations. Liu, you
Alpaca for now.

410
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,610
Can I have another one?

411
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,709
Can I have another one?

412
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,850
Okay, then Alpaka.

413
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,850
OK.

414
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,980
Hello.

415
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,280
Can it be like that? You can't yet
Brash. Is it a menu or a detachment?

416
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,960
The old man was worse.

417
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
This is it.

418
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,400
You have a flower. You can't? Yes, then
Flower.

419
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,200
Can without a color?

420
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,400
Tolerate. You're my Trump card now.

421
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,660
As I think.

422
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,640
Okay, they're always pushing me.

423
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,600
Master, how much for this?

424
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,560
Where did you get it?

425
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,400
Never mind, I'll calculate it and that's it.

426
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,700
Pot?

427
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,120
Hey, don't look at them like a bandit.

428
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,880
Hey, get up there.

429
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,670
Did I kick you out, or what?

430
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,670
You're third time in one place, in one
clothes.

431
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:36,010
Drink with the same hand from one and
Same bottle. Even so much water

432
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,010
same.

433
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,450
What if I want to write? What if the thirst
Tears? Move on.

434
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:18,860
At stake is 10 billion. This is enough for us
For life. Just one thing.

435
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,920
So you're all thinking, right?

436
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,960
But grandmothers are not the main thing.

437
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,720
The main thing is life.

438
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,320
New times are new rules.

439
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,240
If I let myself plan a new business.

440
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,820
You can do it.

441
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,780
Simon! Dad! Dad! Dad! Simon!

442
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,480
Dad! Sivan!

443
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,750
Grounded. Well, let's go.

444
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,970
Thanks, Dad.

445
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,630
I'm going away for a while. Forget about the brothers.

446
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,710
I'm coming back for you.

447
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,210
Duan, he stepped a billion and a half
dollars in the crypt.

448
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,070
Server location is known. AND
We have a Cryptotosdok. But in digital

449
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,110
Getting to storage is difficult.

450
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,450
Daimon in shelter. Right now a plane
busy.

451
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,690
The shelter is good.

452
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,010
There are many memories there.

453
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,750
I know you're tired, but I'll get you together.

454
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,680
Want some coffee?

455
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,240
Cheer up. Looks like I'm tired.

456
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,400
He wasn't thinking of killing me.

457
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,860
Then you can have my share.

458
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,180
How can we, godmother?

459
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,400
I'm already old. I'm not a new one.

460
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,520
Right?

461
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,110
Why did you call me a Trump card?

462
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,550
Gazlaiteite.

463
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,530
Gas what?

464
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,770
Well, try, I'll kill you.

465
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,770
You think you haven't seen him?

466
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,090
Not good enough? Think about me
Need medical help?

467
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,060
No, you're good.

468
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,460
And you don't need a babysitter.

469
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,320
When the blade is in your hand, you can't hesitate.

470
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,120
We need to act.

471
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,560
Otherwise, it shakes you weak.

472
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:32,260
Then why is everybody working there and I'm here?
Can I get you coffee?

473
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,610
What do you want? Uh, yeah.

474
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,550
I really do.

475
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,490
But I need you here.

476
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,010
I need a partner.

477
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,550
This is an order.

478
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,010
So certainly.

479
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,630
Bro,

480
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,750
If Finnie kept 3k, he'd be
loaded.

481
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,430
I really wanted to kill myself.

482
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:25,090
What's tasty? It's simple
Chicken noodle. It's not easy to cook.

483
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:32,950
When I was your years, all I thought about
How to survive.

484
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,960
I envy you guys. You got dreams.

485
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,280
And you dream about them.

486
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:47,620
I just want to live in peace and peace
your brothers.

487
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,140
Not like now.

488
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,100
All these years, helping me, you've deprived
their brothers' attention.

489
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,000
From a very young age, he defended me.

490
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,760
When they poisoned my garbage,

491
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:10,640
I certainly couldn't survive without you.

492
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,020
And seldom have you sustained our life
Sheltered, and without you we would have starved.

493
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,780
Eat mine if you're hungry.

494
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,800
Of all the boys, you're the dearest to me.

495
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,640
Because you're like me.

496
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,260
Rudder is more like.

497
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,280
You think so? Then it's very dangerous.

498
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,540
Yaichko and Toho. Yes? Date's over.

499
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,960
Get dressed and E.

500
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,160
Pudding. Get dressed and B.

501
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,620
Pulp on A.

502
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,080
Recently, something is wrong, therefore
Still not coming. Can about me

503
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,120
Watch out.

504
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,930
Help! Help!

505
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:51,850
Help!

506
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,990
Hey, go back to the car, call the cop.

507
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,930
I'm a cop.

508
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,810
Hey, fall!

509
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,270
In!

510
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,830
This is nothing, a beautiful meel.

511
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,520
And who isn't?

512
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,700
Run.

513
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,760
Hey, let's go.

514
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,300
Let's go.

515
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,390
Disconnected.

516
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,490
Are you aware that you have a pregnancy?

517
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:14,610
My job is to protect citizens. We must
Revenge at the right time.

518
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,330
You have an operational task.

519
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:21,630
What is the task? Operation "lunch for
won." I'm sorry, I failed everything.

520
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:23,710
Listen here.

521
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,330
And for surgery, you can't
disclose whatever's going on.

522
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,520
Not disclosed. He reached for the token.
I'd see a shadow and that's it. Yeah, where is it at all

523
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,660
Fuck? We hang for two weeks. No
Is it time to start working?

524
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,920
We are already working.

525
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,160
Just two weeks.

526
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,860
Do you know what the longest surveillance we have
has been?

527
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,960
Five months.

528
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,620
I know. Only eight.

529
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,120
So?

530
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,240
What then?

531
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,340
My father died from you and a drug dealer
He ran.

532
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,800
And you know that me before is a whole
Have you seen a year?

533
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,090
Yes, it's all from me.

534
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:41,950
I ... you know what I did then?

535
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,870
Just like you.

536
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,630
What a sweet girl.

537
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,750
You want bubbles?

538
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,730
Do you want it or not? Yes.

539
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:57,030
Let's play in the van. There's tons of toys.

540
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,310
Come with me.

541
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,590
What do you need? Let the baby go. Back off. You
WHO?

542
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,890
Let the baby go.

543
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,930
Well, wait.

544
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,170
What's a smart one? He said to stay.
Show you the symbol.

545
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,390
I'll be late after all. Police, booth.

546
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,840
My negligence killed your father.

547
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,340
But you saved the baby.

548
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,960
No.

549
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,060
Do not disassemble, they ran away.

550
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,400
Did they find it after all?

551
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,260
I don't know.

552
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:37,280
As cops, we have to be
rational, disciplined,

553
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,200
Performant.

554
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:48,440
It's better to regret than to be wrong
Now.

555
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,700
Because this is our duty.

556
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,390
Maybe I noticed a shadow. Street market
Bausi.

557
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:50,430
He is in a blue jacket, gray pants,
brown beret.

558
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,390
Maybe with glasses. Seven.

559
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,630
Change your clothes. We will identify.

560
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,430
Attention, everyone is ready.

561
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,850
He noticed a shadow. We're looking behind the square.

562
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,250
A detachment of beautiful people on the road.

563
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:09,290
Alpaca, a sticker in a hundred. Yaichko, tofu,
smell. Lucky, Chris, South. Pudding,

564
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:12,190
Book, North. Shadow, maybe you're already
saw.

565
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,830
Everyone like him remembers everyone.

566
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,720
He will be suspected of cooperation. Stay
At a distance.

567
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,760
Rose.

568
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,180
You need to identify it up close.

569
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,900
He certainly hasn't seen you.

570
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,480
I aim to use the most
Employees not to be refused.

571
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,760
Preferably those they haven't seen.

572
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,380
Merge.

573
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,680
Take your time.

574
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,540
Keep your distance.

575
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,600
Dog's head causes a trans. Detachment
Beautiful people on the scene.

576
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,920
Alpaka, go to a fruit boat
West.

577
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,480
Go slowly, take your time. Our task is
Identify the target.

578
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,720
You can't scare the shadows.

579
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,600
Calm, relaxed.

580
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,900
He is a professional. You can't go wrong.

581
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,920
Sticker. East exit.

582
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,180
Ulka, like CAD. Understood.

583
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,140
Pudin, stay back. Turn around.

584
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,880
Alpaka, do you see his face?

585
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,840
No, I can't see. Hidden under a cover. I can't
Know.

586
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,710
We can see his face.

587
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,450
Ilchha, Shadow, maybe I saw you inside
FOYER.

588
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,570
Don't turn around.

589
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:28,250
Oh, well done.

590
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,790
Rose, your way out.

591
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:43,880
Carefully. I will approach.

592
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,120
Rose, you'll get upset.

593
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,900
I know there is an idea.

594
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:28,690
This is him.

595
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:29,870
I identified myself.

596
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,750
Hands down.

597
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,890
Do not move the camera.

598
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:04,120
Attention everyone, the shadow has been identified. Detachment
Beautiful men change and await command.

599
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,260
Guys, all well done.

600
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,520
The objective is identified, the target is identified. All
Employees maintain a distance of three

601
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,380
Again, I do not address the objective.

602
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,800
Note any sirens.

603
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,760
The target entered the blind spot.

604
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,700
Luck is gone.

605
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,060
The sticker behind it.

606
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,260
It's not that close.

607
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,960
The bastard won't go away.

608
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,420
The day goes to Konda Chancin.

609
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,840
The housings inside are connected.

610
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,220
Shadow in the case, first entry. There
No cameras inside. We'll lose his evidence.

611
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,860
Stop. I'm too far away.
Nice, copy. I'm not gonna make it.

612
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,479
And you stick?

613
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,480
Yaichko and?

614
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,700
Pot.

615
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,860
Familiar.

616
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,640
I'm inside.

617
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,200
Top floor.

618
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,700
What are you?

619
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,100
Did you hear me?

620
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,540
What? Going on a date? My friend is you
saw.

621
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,820
Where are you?

622
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,180
I forgot something.

623
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,580
Get out of here.

624
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,220
Loser, huh?

625
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,110
I knew Sergey would lose with these
Headphones.

626
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,250
And go already, right?

627
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:45,170
Understand? They grow up and don't obey. All
Done against.

628
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:52,110
Yes, they grow up and then they already know more.

629
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,670
What is here to make the father?

630
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:56,110
How open you are.

631
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:59,790
But you won't, they'll start hiding everything from
from you.

632
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,100
And auntie said your coachman looks
Alpaku.

633
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,340
Therefore, you hide her from me. From who?

634
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,640
Your cocol.

635
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,040
And what is wrong with the alpal? The main thing is for me
that.

636
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,720
He is more beautiful than you.

637
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
Fr.

638
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,320
Again, I bought a rotter.

639
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,960
There was no climax? I found a camera.

640
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,460
In the stomach they are the same.

641
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,860
Would you?

642
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:39,880
Pade on bases. Roger that. We got our faces off
Shadows on camera.

643
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,880
Why are you spitting?

644
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,440
There is a cleaner. Everything is in order.

645
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,540
I hope you go out for the rich
guy.

646
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,960
Well, why am the rich father
Brides?

647
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,000
Or maybe they will like it in me?

648
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:03,880
Or maybe you'll think of yourself
Stop eating a rot? I'm for you

649
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,730
Save. It has begun.

650
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:10,270
Goodbye.

651
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:23,230
Which one of you runs like this? Not your business.

652
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:24,910
Try your character.

653
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:26,710
What did he find in you?

654
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,490
Du -te, du -te.

655
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,570
The character is wonderful.

656
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:34,190
What now?

657
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,430
Play play play. This is not possible.

658
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,670
What about you? Maybe we won't come?

659
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,530
Are you kidding?

660
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:45,070
You are so annoying.

661
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,870
Buy, oh, trancerer?

662
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,950
The police quietly close the door.

663
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,690
Close the door, we're here to work.

664
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:14,670
Eighth floor.

665
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:39,890
802. Hooray! The Beak lives in the Chancin of condos.
Building C, first entrance. Confirmed.

666
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,520
Take it.

667
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,840
What kind of sound?

668
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,740
He clicks on the baskets. Is it hockey?

669
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:48,630
And he didn't decide.

670
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,710
Not surprisingly it tore.

671
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,150
Weird.

672
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:57,430
They are all wrong.

673
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,700
In the past, the shadow always disappeared after
Every deal and lies at the bottom.

674
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:35,740
He is a man of principle. But this time he
I broke his rules. What happened?

675
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:41,720
If I'm not mistaken, then let's say, uh, we
scared him off.

676
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,500
But not to play, we will play at it.

677
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,610
Decided not to buy rotten?

678
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,190
Wow.

679
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,430
How much? And seventy.

680
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:09,010
Brown. Ah, nonsense. Twenty cents.
Now everything gets more expensive.

681
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:11,490
It is here. Thank you.

682
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,650
Hey, and there's cheaper.

683
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:19,050
See? Everything was bad there.

684
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:27,630
No, I'm talking about a fish platter. It's cheap.
Right. Right. Here

685
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:30,109
The owner's father is a good man.

686
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,469
10 dollars.

687
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:36,609
Unfortunately, he died suddenly.

688
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,590
Heart attack. No, asthma.

689
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:48,520
Your daughter is an adult. Do I want to go? Ah, me
Played. Her mom threw me.

690
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,960
Then he died, wounded.

691
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,740
The daughter moved in with me.

692
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:55,439
Yes, thank you.

693
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:57,899
Hello. Hello.

694
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,120
What are you doing?

695
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,680
Want to get a casino?

696
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,560
Don't you live on fish? Give me a carp.

697
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,779
See what corn I have.

698
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:10,920
In his youth, he played a lot of cards. I wanted
Become the god of gamblers.

699
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:13,750
I didn't know it only happened in movies.

700
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:19,810
I thought you got corn out of a gun.
I never took it in my hands.

701
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,490
But one of the kids' deals in the kitchen
Mahal.

702
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,649
Let me treat you with something.

703
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:27,229
Come in.

704
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,550
Turn around Stoparik.

705
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:30,790
It's funny.

706
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,710
I used to be a chef myself. My teacher in
Hangzhou.

707
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:38,609
I'm cooking one of these fish swamped. How
Like today?

708
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,560
Maybe. I only have one bottle
Chilean wine. Fish just right.

709
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,080
You're wine, fish from me.

710
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,380
Come on. Have a seat.

711
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,400
I'll refrigerate.

712
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,300
What does it do?

713
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,760
What does it do?

714
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,580
Check the dust on the shelves if they have a lot of time
In.

715
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:16,600
Don't hide. Let your guests
The kitchen all works. Show what you can.

716
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,100
Complete.

717
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,960
Have you worked for a chef for a long time?

718
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,540
More than ten years.

719
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,320
And this is your knife?

720
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:53,100
And you're stuck in knives. Just love
Do things right.

721
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:55,980
Are there children?

722
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,100
I am alone.

723
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,840
Old man alone. And this is home cooking.

724
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:11,320
Your daughter's smart, I watch. By the way.
What's that scar on her forehead?

725
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,940
Yeah, grab a keg, talk to the guest.
OKAY.

726
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,260
Go to the toilet.

727
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,440
Smart.

728
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:34,600
If I had kids, I would too
He banned cell phones at the table.

729
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,740
Launch more converter. Who are you studying for? On
nursing. You'll be a nurse after

730
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,740
Universal?

731
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:49,310
If only in the nursing home.

732
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:52,210
You're a kind of soul.

733
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:57,030
Where did you get a scar? This?

734
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:03,690
This in fifth grade I got into a fight with the others
girls.

735
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:09,970
Why did you put up a fight? Classmate
offended. Couldn't stay away. I

736
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:11,050
said the first.

737
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,940
And your father knows. How does he know?

738
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,020
Weird.

739
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,700
Well, what's there?

740
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,560
So where does he get the scar?

741
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,360
I

742
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:35,780
nobody

743
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,040
We didn't talk about that.

744
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,420
Even mom.

745
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,720
I didn't tell anyone, just as I didn't
concern.

746
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,780
Even the teacher said that the door is not
suitable.

747
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,780
Then how do you know?

748
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:01,980
After our mom's mom, from -s
My debts I had enemies.

749
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,100
I was afraid for you.

750
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:12,400
In fact, I've always been there.

751
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,530
This is the father.

752
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,130
Then why didn't you help me?

753
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:35,630
Didn't help?

754
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,630
Remember what you did with them? I
I was afraid to go in.

755
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:41,390
Oh, come on.

756
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,230
I stayed for a friend.

757
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:44,590
What? What?

758
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:46,090
You committed murder.

759
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:49,930
Pretty good. I touched like this. Shame on me
Here.

760
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:10,390
Well, how?

761
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:14,790
Come on. My clever girl.

762
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:18,610
Thank you.

763
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:20,790
What for?

764
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,110
What has defended us.

765
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:35,970
Some things can't be depressed.

766
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:44,150
All I could do as a father was
Take care of yourself.

767
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:48,270
I know you're worried about me.

768
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:51,390
And you want to protect.

769
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,170
But I've already grown up.

770
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,350
I'll be fine.

771
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,190
That's for sure.

772
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:10,630
Brother, if you're fading, then decide me,
what to do.

773
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:15,830
If we do, you'll have a way back
We won't.

774
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:19,090
I just want to do everything right.

775
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:29,270
They have anti-opening. Looks like a sensor.
Disconnect.

776
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:34,230
Did you hit the data about them?

777
01:15:41,519 --> 01:15:43,100
Answer. What happened?

778
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:44,340
Have you forgotten something?

779
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,600
Nothing to worry about.

780
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,980
Maybe I thought too much?

781
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,480
Thinking? What is it about?

782
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:33,990
I understand you're all grown up now
boy. And it's time to let go.

783
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:14,460
Let's finish your plan. Understood. You
You know what you're doing?

784
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,040
I know.

785
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,100
This is not a plug.

786
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:11,660
Regarding?

787
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,540
Something wrong with the camera. Clearly, this doesn't
Tsugo.

788
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,700
Van needs backup. He's in danger.

789
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:59,110
Unusual. I'll find another way.

790
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,250
Hey, you didn't move?

791
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,850
No, everything is calm.

792
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,720
You had your chance, Ivan.

793
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:41,440
These guys didn't tell Tina what kind of
They're being followed.

794
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:47,220
They knew we would follow
Through the shadows and not touch him.

795
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,220
My murder and my subsequent misery
These would allow Tina to escape.

796
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,260
This time they failed, but they
They will try again.

797
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:10,600
This is a chance not only for them, but for us as well
To end this gang once and for all.

798
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,820
For that much, no one will open you safely.

799
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,900
50 million US dollars.

800
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,080
He agreed.

801
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,570
72 hours later.

802
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:36,250
Shadow walked.

803
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:54,370
The observation group will dissipate.

804
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,900
This is the same taxi as Vausin.

805
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,180
Sending a photo to the observation team.

806
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,880
We are ready. As soon as we get her
Location, we're moving out.

807
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,960
The car is approaching our premises. So
And they decided.

808
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,200
Something is not that.

809
01:21:23,519 --> 01:21:26,120
Stand. Show the chest of drawers again.

810
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,580
Why is it still there?

811
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,640
It wasn't deciphered. They got it wrong.

812
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,120
Point closer again.

813
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:53,949
What is this?

814
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,650
Apparently they were hit by the car.

815
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:38,010
Look, you can hear it. There, as you can hear
Answer.

816
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:39,910
Warning.

817
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:43,410
The car is in the building.

818
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,410
What kind of car?

819
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:57,190
What kind of business?

820
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:58,650
Ma'am, what's going on?

821
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,220
Dupine, prepare the visiting headquarters.

822
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:12,520
Eat. The observation is in force. Follow
Every shadow step.

823
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,160
There.

824
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,680
Someone is still alive.

825
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,080
Put it away.

826
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:06,830
Telephone. Spulberat.

827
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,370
The key to if you don't.
DIFFERENCE.

828
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:14,110
This is Brian. These baskets are also Brian.
Contact the group. Trash encrypts and

829
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:15,110
What's there.

830
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:24,590
Find the phone. I'll cover. I'm gone.

831
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,810
What is this place?

832
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:42,810
Continue thermal imaging surveillance. No
Shadow loop.

833
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:56,030
Captain, they're in the shelter.

834
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,050
Reception.

835
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,440
Sir, come in, we've lost contact as
You can hear a reception.

836
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,480
Brothers, for the work!

837
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,600
Motiv!

838
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:43,870
You know how many cops are on my tail?
200 heads.

839
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:47,210
It would be a faithful death.

840
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:52,570
And do what? So I follow
Hail Moron.

841
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:58,130
And at that time we attacked their headquarters.

842
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:01,570
And the police threw it out immediately.

843
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:08,250
And then I removed the dummy moron.

844
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,580
And he cut this cop's ears off.

845
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:16,040
He was disgusted in the eyes of his subordinates.

846
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,300
Just now.

847
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,420
First you must understand that you are capable
Such as.

848
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:33,340
You're already a big boy. You know what
You did it?

849
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:37,100
What, skinny?

850
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:38,820
Motiv!

851
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,900
The main canals have been flooded. Find
Satellite phone.

852
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,600
We're going away for a while.

853
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,060
Kill at any cost.

854
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,240
Shadow hammer is Braille. Yeah, and Sudoku.

855
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:04,620
Give it to Van.

856
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,420
What the hell? Why are the cops so fast
Are you there?

857
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,760
To be continued ...

858
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:20,810
It didn't work. You had your chance, Ivan.

859
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:25,410
Have you thought what will happen to the old man if
They arrest us?

860
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:30,330
No one is to blame. Just unlucky
It happens.

861
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,750
Simon came up with that? Uh, no.

862
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,660
You still think we're different.

863
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,000
Hey, what are you doing?

864
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:58,700
You don't understand how dangerous it is.

865
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,280
Go away, this was not the plan!

866
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:21,470
The old man must die here for you
the same blessings. Go away, this was not the plan!

867
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:27,450
No, that was my plan.

868
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:34,270
I help you one last time.

869
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:37,570
Which one? Me, or what?

870
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,010
Tsar, okay, here on me.

871
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:43,430
If there is an error, my task is everything
to correct it. I have no choice.

872
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:49,090
I will arrange a dignified ending.

873
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,050
Navigate!

874
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:56,690
Your life will end here.

875
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,160
In position.

876
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:43,690
And we are the wolf.

877
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:48,450
He is our father.

878
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:57,770
In the next life I hope to be

879
01:35:57,770 --> 01:35:59,370
Your biological son.

880
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:52,490
Let go! You'll be worse!

881
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:56,150
Khan for you, I answer!

882
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:07,270
Help their families. Don't let it go by itself.

883
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:10,370
Yes, sir.

884
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:28,790
I think, it's me.

885
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:33,610
We think like a robot. What do we know?

886
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:37,350
The captain reported a large explosion in the
shelter.

887
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:38,429
A shadow?

888
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:40,610
Not known, but we've identified the militants.

889
01:37:40,810 --> 01:37:46,050
Ostensibly, they're a private security company for
particularly high-value clients. But so are they

890
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:49,050
Mercenaries. Taking dangerous business from
Darkelba.

891
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:52,750
Albank contacted material evidence. Soon at
We will be results.

892
01:37:57,309 --> 01:37:58,670
This is Gordon Dee.

893
01:38:00,490 --> 01:38:05,850
Why are stored 10 billion ganger
Police server? Without a decryption key

894
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:10,470
Paired, digital evidence only.
Access only through a digital key.

895
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:13,690
And here are 12 silly passwords
accuracy.

896
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,190
They were here.

897
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:22,890
Mommy, ourselves. (Man) Attention.

898
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:30,410
We've been informed of the robbery. The thieves just
Left. Four men in their early twenties.

899
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:33,150
These were those special forces.

900
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:39,130
They turned off the power so we wouldn't
They managed to remotely disconnect the hacker. To

901
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:42,310
The server needs a local network nearby.
Which means?

902
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,110
The hacker was just here.

903
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:56,690
I was wrong.

904
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:59,650
What did they do wrong?

905
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:01,870
The old man went to take.

906
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,210
Like an idiot.

907
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:06,530
The cops overtook him.

908
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:12,210
That cap's house was too clean.

909
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:14,590
There wasn't even a router, not happening.

910
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:17,470
The old man should have noticed him.

911
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:19,950
But he still played with them.

912
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:22,130
What do you mean?

913
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:30,820
I think he tried to take the cops
on our trail.

914
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:33,360
Is the car a splash?

915
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:42,340
He is not so noble. He is most
Cunning, ruthless.

916
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:45,540
AND...

917
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:52,500
He is ours

918
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,280
father. He is our father.

919
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:00,299
It's you.

920
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,220
Get yourself together. First, go.

921
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:03,940
And then he cries.

922
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:40,160
I lost the Special Forces car in the blind
area. Most likely, they'll run today.

923
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:42,540
Track all trips and departures.

924
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:45,320
For everyone? It takes time.

925
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:46,580
We don't have time.

926
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:47,880
What should we do?

927
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:50,580
Turn on the spices.

928
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,540
Analytical team skills.
Eat.

929
01:40:54,700 --> 01:41:00,020
Let him analyze their handwriting
the thieves. Based on this and previous

930
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,020
actions.

931
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:03,000
Maybe ... ma'am.

932
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,120
The criminals' car disappeared through the calcado
Karmo. A three-kilometer radius

933
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:18,980
A gray van has been discovered. A 67% chance
level. 82% chance

934
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:24,480
They will leave for Win Palais. Win. Come again? I
asked to study, not to repeat the old

935
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,480
Answers.

936
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:29,400
Don't move, hands behind your head, shrug!
Throw a knife!

937
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:30,700
Luminos!

938
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:32,599
Throw a knife!

939
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,720
Come on! Throw a knife! Come on, come on, come on!

940
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Quick!

941
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:43,840
Dean!

942
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:45,580
Dean!

943
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:49,460
The money is still alive! He is alive!

944
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,200
On your knees! Hands behind your head!

945
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,060
Hands behind your head! Get on your knees!

946
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:15,970
Move! On your knees!

947
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:17,470
Stand! On your knees!

948
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:18,730
On your knees!

949
01:42:23,010 --> 01:42:24,410
Uin Bellas.

950
01:42:27,770 --> 01:42:32,070
Take me there. You haven't seen him yet
One of us.

951
01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:34,150
I will betray her.

952
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:42,320
Spice found a similar car at the entrance
of the freeway.

953
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:43,960
Suspicious personalities.

954
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:50,920
No, their number. Winn, an exhibition of paintings,
They're being returned to Paris tomorrow. On the list

955
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,820
Six people added staff.

956
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,580
On the night of the latest Winn robbery
The pictures have flown.

957
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,340
Gopes, buildings, Plan B.

958
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:57,970
I'm a head. The purpose of I. is possible in the laundry.
Pinky, south door of the laundry. I go.

959
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,810
When will the group arrive?

960
01:44:14,610 --> 01:44:15,830
Go on, leave it.

961
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:39,020
Attention! In the south yard, Clusion wins
people.

962
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,160
Maybe the event.

963
01:45:18,349 --> 01:45:20,290
Amendment. Puppy frenzy and leadership.

964
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:41,530
Cap, I'm Peter. Copy.

965
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:45,330
I'm at the party. I think he's here, but no
I can find it.

966
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:46,870
Just calm.

967
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,440
I'm in the zoo. Call him with
Shade rooms.

968
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:52,940
And needles. Let the old man talk to him.

969
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:57,020
Understood.

970
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,300
Godmother? Godmother?

971
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:17,630
Ivan died in vain.

972
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:25,530
I'm watching the phone, the back view is not encrypted.
Don't hide.

973
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:27,890
Binka, don't lose.

974
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:29,530
Follow your faces.

975
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:30,810
Eat.

976
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:35,250
Simon, the police are looking for you.

977
01:46:35,710 --> 01:46:40,330
If I take you, I will be very
Disappointed.

978
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:42,870
I think I've let you down already.

979
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,860
The plan was good.

980
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:49,480
I like it.

981
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:56,860
Thank you, Godfather. But he who knows
What he's doing, he himself would end this matter.

982
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,160
I will consider.

983
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:04,800
In this respect, Sivan fared better.

984
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:22,330
I was so hoping you all could live,
Whatever you want.

985
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:37,010
Thanks, Chief.

986
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:46,790
The shadow was shooting deliberately. If he comes back,
there's a chance to find him. Pinks, remember

987
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:47,790
Surveillance?

988
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:51,990
Consistently exceptional features. I forgot
Not scary.

989
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:56,150
When you see these characteristics, your brain will give you
Know.

990
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:38,550
I see it.

991
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:41,950
He ... reception.

992
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:53,350
Give it!

993
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:03,390
Mommy, Pinky's not answering. Varenik and Tofu
instead.

994
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:05,850
We need ICT target characteristics.

995
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:08,770
Too crowded. Now I see him everywhere.

996
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:12,490
ICT target is eighty meters. Sixty
Eight kilograms. Long hair.

997
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:14,850
This is from Uyway.

998
01:50:15,290 --> 01:50:16,610
He goes to the VIP area.

999
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:18,690
Zapark. Are the dates accurate?

1000
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:20,910
Disconnect it.

1001
01:50:25,530 --> 01:50:30,030
Hold my helmet. I'll get another one.
Report where you are. Shadow just recognized

1002
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:31,210
H. Don't worry about H's goal..

1003
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:34,330
They're twins with the driver.

1004
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:39,270
Yapinka Zoo.

1005
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:41,830
Sorry to disappear. I'm glad you're intact.

1006
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:44,890
You got something? X and the driver are twins.

1007
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:51,670
Looks like it's in the VIP area.

1008
01:50:57,019 --> 01:50:58,700
What for ... sorry.

1009
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:04,040
In vain, they entrusted the wall. Nothing.

1010
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:07,680
Sounds. Tofu south. Parenek North.

1011
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:10,820
Bowji, north of the dance floor. Lapsha and lakes at
Laundry.

1012
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,000
Alpaca. Where is he?

1013
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:16,640
He gave me the headphones and went off again. He
Not activated.

1014
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:19,120
GPS shows it's going to the station.

1015
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:29,770
They're twins with the driver.

1016
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:42,020
So you yourself ... doesn't matter.

1017
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,800
Fragile. Cheers.

1018
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:06,840
Relax. Energize.

1019
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:12,630
Target. Amateur. Family.

1020
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:17,550
Shadow. Betrayal. Recognizer.
ORB.

1021
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:26,790
Times have changed, but the rules remain.

1022
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,950
Simon, goodbye.

1023
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:38,170
God! He's dead! Help!

1024
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:45,150
Look, ma'am! Got two more.

1025
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:47,910
Without a shadow, they didn't know where to hide.

1026
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:49,530
How are you?

1027
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:52,290
Look, ma'am!

1028
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,320
Liu Jinchao.

1029
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:05,480
The artery was hit. Hugo pressed on the wound.

1030
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:07,280
Black lid.

1031
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:08,860
Blue jacket.

1032
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:10,300
Black jeans.

1033
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:15,580
Jinchao.

1034
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,140
Jingchao, don't sleep. Don't sleep.

1035
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,660
Ambulance. Call an ambulance.

1036
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:45,290
I understand what you're going through, but go on
Another detachment's been called in. We got us

1037
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:46,290
exercises.

1038
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:53,250
Then I take the cast. For personal reasons.

1039
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:16,870
Hey. What are you in here?

1040
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:19,570
He sent me to make you
company.

1041
01:55:21,010 --> 01:55:23,350
Eat. Thank you.

1042
01:55:23,690 --> 01:55:24,930
What is known?

1043
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:28,030
Nothing. The day seemed to evaporate.

1044
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:50,020
Money. They always have a trail.

1045
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:52,440
Especially in such a case.

1046
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:02,260
Crypto was transferred there with the first victim.
The boys split up. Only two know

1047
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:04,640
password. And one of them is dead.

1048
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:07,480
And the money hasn't moved? No.

1049
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:08,860
Remember

1050
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:11,000
Did I tell you what a shadow won?

1051
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:15,320
Old. Olgulny.

1052
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:20,200
I don't mean shit about it and I think he
Same ones.

1053
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:24,560
He is a man of this era.

1054
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:29,580
What do you think it will do?

1055
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:36,120
He doesn't know how to retract a crypt.

1056
01:56:41,009 --> 01:56:46,490
Fu was an old thief. Raisha he
handwriting was to steal jewelry and

1057
01:56:46,490 --> 01:56:49,470
victims of predation not to mess
With the Hucksters.

1058
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:57,210
That's all it can.

1059
01:56:59,690 --> 01:57:00,690
Hey, go!

1060
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:02,430
Dată. Come on!

1061
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,500
Why is the door impossible?

1062
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,560
So much faster.

1063
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:21,860
Sofia! Where are you?

1064
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:24,360
Where are you?

1065
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:25,700
What is this?

1066
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:28,060
Tell me, where are you? Am I lost?

1067
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:31,160
Trust instincts.

1068
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:33,020
They will disappoint me, they will accuse me.

1069
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,740
I wanted to.

1070
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:41,580
I've been thinking about this recently.

1071
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:49,660
Debt realization is our task. But
Blood, emotions, heart -

1072
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:51,800
This is our nature.

1073
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:56,920
Our work should not take this away.

1074
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:08,040
And in the past you've acted correctly.

1075
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:19,280
Want 400 bucks?

1076
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:24,400
Find the 1xbet website, get a bonus for
registration and bet on any

1077
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:44,760
Police. Everybody out.

1078
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:54,030
I know you want to make history,
But don't become an accomplice.

1079
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:59,910
Fu asked Yaru for 10 million for
password. The date at Teen Teen sang.

1080
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,270
I'll get over it. Don't stay without us.

1081
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:10,310
Fu, how long are you? Ten minutes.

1082
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:11,550
There. Less than five.

1083
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:19,000
We're listening to the Fyugo phone.

1084
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,440
Understood.

1085
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:27,000
Sound check. Sounds perfect.

1086
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:31,320
The van is late for 10 minutes. He will leave with
Minutes for one minute.

1087
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:40,100
Leaving.

1088
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:48,370
This is an official entrance, guests there.

1089
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:10,450
The world is crowded.

1090
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:22,520
One here?

1091
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:27,740
You have identified yourself.

1092
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:31,800
You didn't recognize?

1093
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:36,080
You and I had dinner.

1094
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,500
I forgot already, didn't I?

1095
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:43,780
Want to?

1096
02:00:55,310 --> 02:00:56,670
I am so touched.

1097
02:00:58,450 --> 02:01:04,710
Uncle, is that you? What are you wearing? AND
Your hair is so awful. I thought of something

1098
02:01:04,710 --> 02:01:06,410
The old pervert is pumping.

1099
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:13,770
Well, sorry to scare me. Uh, it's nothing.

1100
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:18,650
You wanted to leave.

1101
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:21,290
I decided to follow me.

1102
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:31,480
Alone?

1103
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:34,960
What? What do you mean?

1104
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:40,140
A few days ago you won.

1105
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,900
It was with a guy.

1106
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:48,940
Where is this guy?

1107
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:55,920
Dead.

1108
02:01:57,470 --> 02:02:00,830
They broke up. Can't you hear me?

1109
02:02:02,770 --> 02:02:04,390
He is dead.

1110
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:08,190
His

1111
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:15,190
Killed further

1112
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:16,190
station.

1113
02:02:36,010 --> 02:02:37,930
That guy was a cop.

1114
02:02:40,190 --> 02:02:42,850
And you're a cop. What are you wearing?

1115
02:02:43,710 --> 02:02:44,710
Leave me alone!

1116
02:02:46,230 --> 02:02:47,230
Leave me alone!

1117
02:02:56,370 --> 02:02:58,850
Were you able to talk to me?

1118
02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:00,970
Not bad.

1119
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:15,920
Oh!

1120
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:19,860
Call an ambulance, police!

1121
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:23,020
Come out straight, come out!

1122
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,560
This is an official exit.

1123
02:04:40,330 --> 02:04:43,030
How do you like my flooded fish?

1124
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:45,430
Ca?

1125
02:04:49,570 --> 02:04:51,010
Your fish!

1126
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:54,650
Go to hell!

1127
02:04:55,450 --> 02:04:57,010
And you're with me!

1128
02:07:24,590 --> 02:07:25,590
Come on!

1129
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:01,040
Are you okay?

1130
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:03,120
The wound is superficial. I will live.

1131
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:06,280
The ambulance is almost here.

1132
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:07,980
Headphones in your pocket.

1133
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,660
Lego, follow him.

1134
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:16,600
The target passed through the front line. Black
Jacket, wig. I'm behind him.

1135
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:47,880
Pinky, he's headed north. There ain't no room.
You'll have to find him yourself.

1136
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:54,840
I think I can see it.

1137
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:00,000
No, not him.

1138
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:06,360
There is a labyrinth. I don't see it.

1139
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:08,160
Xuga, calm.

1140
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:10,480
Get up.

1141
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:16,950
I don't see him.

1142
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:23,910
Pinks, backup nearby. He couldn't
Get away. You can.

1143
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:32,470
Remember the new surveillance?

1144
02:10:32,690 --> 02:10:33,690
Kecege.

1145
02:10:35,410 --> 02:10:38,270
Forget and remember. You only get one chance.

1146
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:39,810
Key features.

1147
02:10:40,090 --> 02:10:41,090
Completely on your own.

1148
02:10:44,490 --> 02:10:45,530
Remember.

1149
02:10:46,650 --> 02:10:52,410
Remember first -Acting. Over the hour
You will start to remember subconsciously.

1150
02:11:00,130 --> 02:11:01,550
Next.

1151
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:04,710
Friends.

1152
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:11,910
Bandaj.

1153
02:11:31,090 --> 02:11:32,450
I see the target. Where are you?

1154
02:11:32,690 --> 02:11:34,250
Alee south of Ruo de Mayo.

1155
02:11:34,590 --> 02:11:35,790
Prepare for detention.

1156
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:43,990
You can't take that much anesthetic.

1157
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:45,350
Who?

1158
02:11:45,610 --> 02:11:47,750
Who? You can't.

1159
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:52,130
Stop.

1160
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:56,190
Tigo, if we organize a visit to
Institution, can you bring us to us?

1161
02:11:57,930 --> 02:11:59,590
Captain, I can't.

1162
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:02,640
I need support for the observation group.

1163
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,100
Pinks, listen.

1164
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:10,120
Center, in a long position for 8 hours.

1165
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:12,900
Varenik on a parallel street, 3 hours.

1166
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:16,100
Top in place, 9 hours.

1167
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:23,080
Zoo, come in. Head is secure.

1168
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:33,300
Lapsha in place. Two hours. I studied
Shadow habits. I see 165 waste

1169
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:36,880
ways. 17 of them lead through the chapel.

1170
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:41,620
Pudding instead. Right behind you. Noodle
in your seat. Right before your goal.

1171
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:49,040
The coordinates are already with the group. I'll continue
Calculate the march. I'm blue. Home

1172
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:50,040
loc.

1173
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:53,520
Alpaca instead.

1174
02:12:56,230 --> 02:12:57,530
Zoo. They're pink.

1175
02:12:59,490 --> 02:13:00,650
Pinks instead.

1176
02:13:01,450 --> 02:13:02,450
Simpse, attention!

1177
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:06,610
A 280-meter north chapel -
objectives.

1178
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:09,770
The Beak is hurt. Life is dear to him. He wants
Just escape.

1179
02:13:10,530 --> 02:13:12,910
But he won't go to the photos.

1180
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:16,970
Simpse, you are now hounds. Start
Hunting.

1181
02:14:37,930 --> 02:14:38,930
Don't move!

1182
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:45,090
Hands in the air!

1183
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:08,050
I'm fine.

1184
02:15:18,670 --> 02:15:20,630
I'm from the police.

1185
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:23,150
Pulian, you're under arrest.

1186
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:28,510
Ma'am.

1187
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:30,610
Hatsyugo.

1188
02:15:32,190 --> 02:15:34,890
That's thanks to you.

1189
02:15:35,710 --> 02:15:37,770
You can forge.

1190
02:15:47,810 --> 02:15:49,690
What's funny?

1191
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:53,330
Can you fight? Silence!

1192
02:16:19,929 --> 02:16:22,450
Well done. Parents would be proud of you.

1193
02:16:26,870 --> 02:16:27,870
There.

1194
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:31,750
Allow me to question?

1195
02:16:32,090 --> 02:16:34,889
You're on a wish. Please undo the destruction.

1196
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:38,950
I missed work.

1197
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:42,670
We still need your help.

1198
02:16:43,410 --> 02:16:45,969
I've already taught them everything I know.

1199
02:16:48,270 --> 02:16:50,930
So back to retirement.

1200
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:54,170
Just to the hospital first.
