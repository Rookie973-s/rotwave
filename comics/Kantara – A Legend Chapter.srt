Jabba just to be safe?

323
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:08,438
Yeah, right!

324
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:11,188
He left our people behind
because they chopped his toes.

325
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,729
How will he even keep us safe?

326
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,771
I’m saying this because I’ve seen it.

327
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,188
Nah! You ran first!

328
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:17,813
I know what they’re capable of.

329
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:20,604
From now on, the border
watchers must stay alert.

330
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:22,604
- Berme!
- Yeah?

331
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,563
Dispose the bodies outside the border.

332
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,846
Let no more people
come looking for them.

333
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:27,954
Yeah. Sure.

334
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:31,111
Phew! Jabba said the same thing.

335
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,220
Cross the border!

336
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:34,162
What about the Brahma-Rakshasa?

337
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:36,312
- It's all a cooked up story!
- Really?

338
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:40,354
Berme, shouldn't we at least
know which direction to take?

339
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:42,229
We've got a guiding
spirit, don't we?

340
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,438
Dodda, hand me the axe.

341
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:45,688
If he’s been out this
long, I doubt he’ll wake up.

342
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:47,938
- Better to kill him, right?
- Yes!

343
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:50,104
- HEY!
- WAIT!

344
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:51,729
I'm back. Tell me.

345
00:21:52,468 --> 00:21:55,010
Did we have to do this at
the edge of the waterfalls?

346
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:56,288
My legs are trembling!

347
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:58,760
What stone is this?
It's sharp as hell!

348
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:01,104
This isn't stone.
It's iron.

349
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:02,646
Our Sankappa makes them.

350
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,938
Don't eat iron.
Your tongue will rust.

351
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,146
- Hello! Sire?
- Yeah?

352
00:22:07,188 --> 00:22:08,563
How far is your place from here?

353
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:12,021
It's a day's journey by walk.

354
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:14,063
- You'll take us, right?
- Sure. Wait!

355
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:15,563
Why do you guys want to come?

356
00:22:15,563 --> 00:22:17,771
Shouldn’t we see
how far you’ve come?

357
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:18,813
And?

358
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:20,104
We'll return after, won't we?

359
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,729
If they find out that
I got you guys there

360
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:24,688
My life there too will
turn into a living hell.

361
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:26,646
Why do you think
you're taking us?

362
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,188
We're coming there drop you.

363
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,438
Sure that's what you think.

364
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,938
But they should get it, right?

365
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:33,146
God!

366
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:35,021
Okay then. Let's
pray to him and leave.

367
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,354
- What?!
- Yeah.

368
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,188
We're crossing the forest
boundary for the first time.

369
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:40,438
The rest is on you.

370
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:41,729
Bless us, Swami Panjurli.

371
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:42,813
Swami Panjurli.
[IN UNISON]

372
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,979
- What's happening?
- That is the Daiva we believe in.

373
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:46,729
I swear I don’t see anything.

374
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:48,396
You need true
devotion to see it.

375
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:50,271
Doesn’t matter. Just
pray with your heart.

376
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:57,979
I can now see it too.

377
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,229
I forgot to tell you.

378
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:03,354
Nobody but soldiers are
allowed to cross the border!

379
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:05,563
Now they will, won't they?
Good plan.

380
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:07,188
Phew! Thank God I'm alive!

381
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:09,146
I don't even wear anything inside.

382
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,646
Listen, what is a Brahma-rakshasa?

383
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:12,729
It's nothing.

384
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,396
- Once...
- Quiet. Let me tell him.

385
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:16,563
Once upon a time,
there was an evil king.

386
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,729
Wait, we have one too.

387
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,313
YEAH. HIM.
[IN UNISON]

388
00:23:20,188 --> 00:23:21,896
He couldn't find anyone to work.

389
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:23,354
So he performed a great penance.

390
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:25,313
Why a penance?
He could have just paid more!

391
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:27,021
- Just listen. Will you?
- Don't interrupt.

392
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:29,354
Sages and saints offered
him a man as a helper and said -

393
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,313
"Give him so much work
that he has no free time."

394
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:32,396
Why's that?

395
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:34,354
If you let him free,
he'll eat humans.

396
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:35,729
- My God!
- Yeah!

397
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:37,688
- There's more.
- Let me continue.

398
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:40,104
You can stop here.
I’ve lost my zeal.

399
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:41,604
Already? Let me fill you up.

400
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:43,646
- There's more for you to know.
- This is enough.

401
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,854
- My heartbeat's really high.
- We'll stop that. Don't worry.

402
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:48,354
He did exactly as told.

403
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:50,688
When jobless, he
would gobble humans.

404
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:52,688
One time, he was about to eat the King.

405
00:23:52,688 --> 00:23:54,813
The queen immediately
pulled out a curly hair strand,

406
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,146
and asked him to straighten it.

407
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:57,813
- Did he straighten it?
- No way!

408
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,063
He's still busy straightening
it out in the forest.

409
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,771
Who is this idiot?!

410
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,021
The Brahma-rakshasa!

411
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:05,563
- What?! Him?!
- Yep!

412
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:06,646
Good Lord!

413
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,063
What if he straightens it
and appears in front of me?

414
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:10,271
He'll straighten me out!

415
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:15,729
All I want now is to meet Jayanthi.

416
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:18,021
- Who's that?
- A chunk of the crescent moon.

417
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:19,188
Ah.

418
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:21,646
What's that?

419
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:24,063
Bangra's walls.

420
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:30,563
Did Sankappa build this too?

421
00:24:30,563 --> 00:24:33,188
Yes. This was the first
move of King Rajashekhara.

422
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,396
Open the gates!

423
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:40,063
Berme, our clothes would've busted us here.

424
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,979
Shut up and walk straight!

425
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:43,563
Oy Chenna! The king
returned yesterday.

426
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:44,688
What took you so long?

427
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:46,729
Well, the forest had
plenty to explore.

428
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,729
- Then where's the prey?
- Right here!

429
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,563
Please shut your traps!

430
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:53,521
- Attending the King's first assembly?
- Maybe if I'm free.

431
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,813
What's taking the King so long?

432
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:03,104
The king rises early, meditates, prays,
then lights the lamp before coming here.

433
00:25:03,313 --> 00:25:04,396
So, naturally he's late.

434
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:07,896
This is what I love
about you, King.

435

Even after taking the throne

436
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:12,729
You haven’t changed a bit.

437
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:15,521
You're still the same old Kulashekhara.

438

Bhogendra, It's noon already!

The assembly's waiting! Hurry up!

- We will.
- Noon already, huh?

This is your first
assembly as a king!

443

They shouldn't find out we're drunk.

She shouldn't spot us.
