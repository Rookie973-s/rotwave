2
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:28,705
Yes, Mr. Burnish,

3
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:30,807
the venue
is completely sold out.

4
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:33,076
This is the most important
discovery of the century,

5
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:34,945
and everyone wants to see it.

6
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:36,846
Yes, the press will be there.

7
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,782
This is your big day,
Mr. Burnish.

8
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:40,717
You won't be disappointed. I promise.

9
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:44,888
Easy. Easy, boy.

10
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,923
Code Red!

11
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,659
Who left the enclosure open?

12
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,962
Stay back!

13
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:18,757
All right, move in slowly.

14
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:23,893
No sudden movements.

15
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:30,100
What's happening?

16
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:33,837
Oh!

17
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:37,140
- Whoa!
- Oh!

18
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,947
Um...

19
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,084
who's telling Mr. Burnish?

20
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:14,003
On your right.

21
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,239
- Hey, want to shoot some hoops?
- Maybe later.

22
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,041
- Number two, extra spicy.
- <i>Xie xie.</i>

23
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,076
Nah. Nah,
I'm going out with Peilin,

24
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:22,178
but, uh...
eh, maybe I'll stop by.

25
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,148
Aw, it would be
so fun if you could come.

26
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,184
Yi!

27
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,886
I'm leaving for work.

28
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:31,022
Yi?

29
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:34,258
Are you awake?

30
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,895
Bye, everybody.
Have a great day.

31
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:41,030
Eh. What are you
supposed to be?

32
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:43,032
A famous person now?

33
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,901
Uh, where are you going?

34
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:46,270
I've got stuff to do.

35
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:48,238
Stuff? What is this stuff?

36
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,939
It's summer holiday.

37
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,075
Either be busy,
or be on holiday.

38
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:53,710
That is what I say.

39
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:55,044
- Be careful out there.
- Of course.

40
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,246
Be back before dinner.

41
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:57,281
- I'll try.
- Warm enough?

42
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:58,948
- Toasty.
- No boys.

43
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,318
- What? No, no boys.
- Do you need any money?

44
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,255
Mom, Nai Nai,
I've got it covered.

45
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:05,955
Bye.

46
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,327
Okay. Bye.

47
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:13,029
What on earth do you think
she does all day?

48
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,300
Whoa! Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

49
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:17,934
- Heel.
- Hey!

50
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:19,202
- Would you guys give me a break?
- Hey!

51
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:21,505
Whoa, whoa!

52
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,075
Oh, my babies.

53
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:27,278
Money transfer?

54
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,245
Sorry. It's cash only.

55
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,986
We'll be back in a few hours.

56
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:39,292
- Hey, cutie.
- You're not my mom!

57
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:06,149
So, Jin, are you
going to Shuo's this weekend?

58
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:08,352
No. No, I'm heading to Beijing
to check out my school.

59
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:10,987
- I'm, uh, premed.
- Nice.

60
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:13,122
- Oh, med school?
- That's so hot.

61
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,792
I know, right?

62
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,994
Ugh. What's that...

63
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:19,731
smell?

64
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,133
She looks like she slept
in a dumpster.

65
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,005
Selfie!

66
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:40,116
He breaks left.
He breaks right.

67
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:42,118
He's going in for the dunk!

68
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,354
Whoa!

69
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:44,921
Hey, Yi.

70
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:47,156
Come shoot hoops with me.
Come on.

71
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,260
Sorry, Peng.
I don't have time.

72
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:51,027
Wh-Why don't you ask
the other kids?

73
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,396
The other kids are too little.

74
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:56,300
And some of them
are freakishly good.

75
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:59,102
Come on, Yi, you never play
with me anymore.

76
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:01,904
Peng, I've been busy all day.

77
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,307
Hey, hey, your cousin
will play with you.

78
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:04,974
Yeah, yeah,
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

79
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:06,242
Light show starts at 8:00.

80
00:07:06,244 --> 00:07:08,077
Uh, buh-bye.

81
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,013
As usual, he's got a date.

82
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:14,451
Wait, wait. Yi, watch.

83
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:15,852
Here we go.

84
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:17,987
Three, two, one.

85
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:21,057
Stop and check.

86
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:23,059
Hey, Yi, you know
I can smell you

87
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,994
from all the way
over here, right?

88
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:26,162
Like you can talk.

89
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:27,364
I'm sorry, is there any
aftershave left,

90
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:29,032
or did you use
the whole bottle?

91
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,900
Why?
You hoping to borrow some?

92
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:33,903
- Oof, not sure it'll help.
- Very funny.

93
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:36,340
You guys want to work out some
of this tension on the court?

94
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:38,941
Forget it, Peng. We wouldn't
want to mess up Jin's hair.

95
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:41,944
And the new kicks.
No basketball for these babies.

96
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:44,013
Another time, okay, coz?

97
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:46,115
That's what you always say.

98
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:49,120
48 likes. Sweet!

99
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:53,357
Don't.
I know what you're thinking,

100
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,292
so just don't say it.

101
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:58,127
She's never at home anymore.

102
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,463
Ma.

103
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,164
That's all I'm gonna say.

104
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,468
Not another word.

105
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,235
So, that's it?

106
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,505
We're just going to
give up on her?

107
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:11,040
I'd never give up on Yi.

108
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:14,110
Look, we both know
what she's been going through.

109
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,112
She misses her dad.

110
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:17,980
We all do.

111
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:21,385
If we're patient and don't
push her, then just maybe...

112
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:23,454
Yi, is that you?

113
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,988
We've been waiting
for you to eat.

114
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,925
Oh, I-I ate on my way back,
so I'm good.

115
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,262
Either eat here or there,
but never on the move.

116
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:34,264
That is what I say.

117
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,467
Hey, Yi,
why don't we all sit down

118
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,435
together tonight as a family?

119
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,537
Family.

120
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,238
You need to eat.

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,074
You don't want to be
so short like your mother.

122
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,377
Oh, I'm-I'm okay.
Thank you, Nai Nai.

123
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:48,077
Yi, wait.

124
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,279
What would you say to playing

125
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,080
a little violin for us
after supper?

126
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:54,016
- Remember when you used to...
- I-I can't.

127
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:55,452
Can't? Why?

128
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:58,322
Uh, because I...

129
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:01,291
I-I sold it.

130
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:04,195
I, uh... I'm sorry.

131
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:12,101
No.

132
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:01,387
I will take this trip.

133
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,031
Someday.

134
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,200
Okay.

135
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:07,313
Okay.

136
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:27,231
No, no, no, no.

137
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:44,213
Huh?

138
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,441
Hold up. Spotted something
at two o'clock.

139
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:13,343
There's nothing there.

140
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:15,146
Moving on.

141
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:21,380
Oh.

142
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,525
Hi, Mom.
Bye, Nai Nai.

143
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:38,328
Excuse me.

144
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:45,402
Bam! It came out of nowhere.

145
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,506
Then it was gone.

146
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:50,841
Did you see where it went?

147
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:53,710
Lady, I just told you.
It was gone.

148
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,746
What, uh... what was it anyway?

149
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:59,485
Um, let me take care
of the repairs to your truck.

150
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:04,821
A little compensation
for your silence.

151
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:06,425
It's a bribe.

152
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:30,914
Nai Nai, that's weird.

153
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,417
- Oh, so you're hungry now, hmm?
- Oh, yeah.

154
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:35,819
Starving.

155
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:38,522
Let them cool.
You'll burn your mouth.

156
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:39,856
I keep telling your mother

157
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:42,425
- you need to slow down.
- Ow! Ow!

158
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:45,128
- Spend more time here, at home with your family.
- Ow.

159
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,130
- Ow.
- Mrs. Lui called me today.

160
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:50,133
Says you're fixing
her computer.

161
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:52,836
And Mrs. Yuan in 4-B says

162
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:55,672
you're going to trim
her poodle's toenails.

163
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:57,774
I like that you're ambitious.

164
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:00,744
No one wants
a lazy granddaughter.

165
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,813
But, uh, busy, busy, busy.

166
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,582
What do you need to do
all that for?

167
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:07,450
I guess I just like being busy.

168
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:08,718
Yi.

169
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,854
Can we just talk
about this later, Nai Nai?

170
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,689
You don't have to worry.

171
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:14,724
You should listen to Nai Nai!

172
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,579
Hey, boy.

173
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,513
Or girl.

174
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:38,415
Are you hungry?

175
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:39,983
Whoa!

176
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,762
Hoo!
Yeah, you're definitely a boy.

177
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,764
Whoa.

178
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:07,271
I don't know
where you came from,

179
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:10,642
but you...
sure don't belong here.

180
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:16,846
You stay in here, okay?

181
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:19,451
There-there are people
looking for you.

182
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:24,521
Hmm.

183
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,600
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay. Okay.

184
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:13,505
No. Please don't cry.

185
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,009
Wait.

186
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:27,117
My dad used to play for me.

187
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,821
It always made me feel better.

188
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:14,966
All better, right?

189
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:27,411
Uh...

190
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:28,978
The...

191
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:33,149
Nah.

192
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,186
Good night, sleepyhead.

193
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:50,900
Wait.

194
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:52,836
Do you know that place?

195
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:59,742
Is that... is that your home?

196
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:03,847
You know, uh, um, home.

197
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,157
No way.

198
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,293
Okay.

199
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:18,027
Come on.

200
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:20,464
Creature from Mount Everest.

201
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,966
"Considered to be no more
than fairy tale and myth,

202
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:24,234
"enthusiasts still
hold out hope

203
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:27,471
that these creatures
actually do exist."

204
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:33,843
There's a yeti on my roof.

205
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:38,948
Captain, I am holding
you personally responsible

206
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,018
for that abominable
creature's escape.

207
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,922
Now, you will get every car
we have out there,

208
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:49,859
or I will send you back to
your job at the shopping mall.

209
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:51,194
Uh, yes, sir. Understood.

210
00:21:51,196 --> 00:21:52,795
Attention, all units.

211
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:54,933
We need every car
out on the street.

212
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:58,262
I was dribbling,
and the guy was like, "Oh, no,"

213
00:22:58,264 --> 00:23:00,264
and I was like, "Oh, yeah."

214
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,831
Want to play a game?

215
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,267
I can't.
Nai Nai will, though.

216
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:05,868
Hey, Nai Nai,
want to shoot some hoops?

217
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,005
You know I only play for money.

218
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:11,910
Uh, something's missing.

219
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:14,378
What in the...?

220
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,079
Peng, go get your cousin Jin

221
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:18,948
and see who stole
my air conditioner.

222
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,287
Go. Go, go, go, go.

223
00:23:22,854 --> 00:23:25,422
Hey. Uh, what are you
doing out here?

224
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:27,391
Someone's gonna see you.

225
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:29,993
Where did you get that?
No, no, no, no, no.

226
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,595
Give it back now!

227
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,399
Do you hear me? Let go!

228
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:37,100
Peng, that does not make sense.

229
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:39,168
Why would they take it
to the roof?

230
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,105
Oh!

231
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:44,275
- Guys, what are you doing up here?
- Hey! Uh, hey!

232
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:46,277
- Get away from her!
- No. No, no, no, wait.

233
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,044
Okay, I'm calling the police.
Hello? Hello?

234
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:49,613
- No. Jin, don't.
- Yes, uh, there's a...

235
00:23:49,615 --> 00:23:51,615
- there's a wild beast on our roof.
- Hang up, Jin.

236
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:53,049
- No, no. Stop, Jin.
- Yes. Um...

237
00:23:53,051 --> 00:23:54,150
...a wild beast.

238
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:55,918
- Turn up that scanner.
- Yeah, yeah, on Heping Road.

239
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,854
- Please hurry.
- That's him.

240
00:23:57,856 --> 00:23:59,623
That's the yeti.
Ring Mr. Burnish.

241
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,326
Jin, what have you done?
He's not dangerous.

242
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:06,463
Look at him. He's a yeti.

243
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:08,399
- Cool.
- What?

244
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:11,000
No, y-yetis don't exist.

245
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:13,102
Oh, no.

246
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:14,373
They're back!

247
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:17,641
You have to go.

248
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:19,008
Go. Run. Now.

249
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,078
Go.

250
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:25,948
Wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.

251
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,951
No. No, no.

252
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:38,295
Wait.

253
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:39,929
Yi!

254
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:42,965
He stole Yi.

255
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:45,371
More like kidnapped.

256
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:48,372
Come on, Peng.

257
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,913
Yi!

258
00:24:58,249 --> 00:24:59,949
We're never gonna
catch up to them.

259
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:01,918
Hey, Jin.

260
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,487
Hey, girls.

261
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:04,987
Whoo!

262
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:06,490
How many girlfriends
do you have?

263
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:13,497
Hurry!

264
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:15,299
Whoa!

265
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:17,001
Whoa, whoa.

266
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:23,275
They're gaining on us.

267
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:29,045
Locked on target.

268
00:25:30,449 --> 00:25:33,149
Dude, you darted Dave.

269
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,353
Uh, yeah, we lost them.

270
00:25:36,355 --> 00:25:38,389
I want eyes on that target
at all times.

271
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:41,157
It cannot leave the city.

272
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:46,028
Watch out!

273
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,297
Hold on, Peng.

274
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:49,098
There! There they are.

275
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,033
Whoa!

276
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:56,306
Whoa!

277
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:58,475
Whoa!

278
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:05,516
I think we lost them.

279
00:26:05,518 --> 00:26:07,083
Look, down there.

280
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:08,452
That boat's leaving the city.

281
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:11,087
You-you have to get on it.

282
00:26:22,468 --> 00:26:24,068
Get into position.

283
00:26:26,605 --> 00:26:29,339
- Oh, there she is!
- Oh, my gosh!

284
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:30,607
Take the shot.

285
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:32,074
What?

286
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:34,076
There's a girl with him?

287
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:36,313
Oh, no.
How is she gonna get away?

288
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:39,516
Wait, wait.
What time is it?

289
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:41,518
8:00. Why?

290
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,587
Time for the light show.

291
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:53,497
Ooh! Aah!

292
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,231
Come on, Yi.

293
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:03,105
Where are they?

294
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,207
They're gone.

295
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,142
Copy that. They're gone.

296
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:08,110
And I'm dead.

297
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:10,112
Don't rub it in.

298
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:12,451
Come on!
Keep searching!

299
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,653
Oh! There they are.

300
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:19,256
Come on, Peng.

301
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:21,293
Over there. That one.

302
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,667
You have to get on that boat.

303
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:32,503
When that boat lands,
don't stop.

304
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:34,404
Don't stop until
you reach your mountain.

305
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:36,205
Don't stop until you're home.

306
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:38,140
Okay? Home.

307
00:27:40,144 --> 00:27:42,111
Oh, you-you have to go. Now!

308
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:48,117
Hide.

309
00:27:57,195 --> 00:27:58,462
Yi!

310
00:27:58,464 --> 00:28:00,231
Yi, are you okay?

311
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:03,600
Oh, no.

312
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:07,573
Oh, no, no, no, Yi.
Don't you dare!

313
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,479
Yi!

314
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,560
I guess I'm coming with you,
huh... Everest?

315
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:32,429
Yi?

316
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:34,398
Yi, are you crazy?!

317
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,303
- Wait for me!
- Peng? Peng! No!

318
00:28:39,471 --> 00:28:42,171
No, no, no, no, no, no!

319
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,475
Peng!

320
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:48,512
I'm responsible for you.

321
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:50,614
Your mom's gonna kill me.

322
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:54,520
My babies.

323
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:58,589
No, no, no.
You think this is funny?

324
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:00,490
Do you even know
how much I paid for these?

325
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:07,497
What were you thinking, Yi?

326
00:29:07,499 --> 00:29:10,500
You have gotten me
into so much trouble.

327
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:13,202
I am so mad at you right now.
You know what?

328
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:15,706
I-I can't even talk to you
right now! That's how mad I am!

329
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,393
The unveiling is
in one week, Captain.

330
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:39,663
Now, how am I supposed
to prove the yeti exists

331
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:43,667
when I don't have a yeti?

332
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:45,535
- Uh...
- No speaking!

333
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,604
Only leaving.

334
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:51,742
Dr. Zara,
what am I going to do?

335
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,744
The science community
will be there.

336
00:29:53,746 --> 00:29:55,479
The press will be there.

337
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:59,616
The world will be there,
watching with their eyes.

338
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:02,653
Mr. Burnish, there are
many rare and exotic animals

339
00:30:02,655 --> 00:30:04,421
you have collected
over the years.

340
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:05,989
These snakes, for example.

341
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:07,557
You're the only one
in the world

342
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,293
to have a newly born clutch
of rare whooping snakes.

343
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:14,264
Down, down, down!

344
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:17,534
Go in your hole,
you weird snakes.

345
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:19,336
Sir, please.

346
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:21,738
These creatures
are to be respected.

347
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:24,675
Hmm.

348
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:26,476
They would make a lovely belt.

349
00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:29,312
Mr. Burnish,
they are one of a kind.

350
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:30,580
A one-of-a-kind whooping belt.

351
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:32,649
A belt that goes "whoop."
Do I want that?

352
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,284
I don't know.

353
00:30:35,454 --> 00:30:38,355
Take them away.

354
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:40,590
Wait, how many snakes
are there supposed to be?

355
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:42,359
Uh, why?

356
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:46,797
We promised the public a yeti,

357
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,466
and nothing else will do.
Nothing!

358
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:52,602
I don't care if the yeti
is dead or alive.

359
00:30:52,604 --> 00:30:54,604
I just need him.

360
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:57,607
Your gerbil is freaking me out.

361
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:01,311
Jerboa.
Duchess is an albino jerboa,

362
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:03,313
and she, too, is one of a kind.

363
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:06,817
Sir, as a zoologist,
it is my mission in life

364
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:09,052
to make sure that all animals
are protected,

365
00:31:09,054 --> 00:31:11,354
especially the rare
and exotic ones.

366
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:14,491
That is the only reason
I agreed to find your yeti.

367
00:31:14,493 --> 00:31:15,792
And you did.

368
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:19,629
For a few short days,
we had one,

369
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:24,634
but I cannot go
to that unveiling empty-handed.

370
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:27,637
I will not be made
into a laughingstock again.

371
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,773
Not, not, not, not, not!

372
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:31,842
Uh, there's news, Mr. Burnish.

373
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:33,510
News about you leaving?

374
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:35,512
A dockworker saw
a creature and some kids

375
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:37,514
boarding a cargo barge
last night.

376
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:40,517
Dr. Zara, you are the best
in your field.

377
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,552
Please, help me get him back.

378
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:44,554
Under one condition.

379
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:46,790
We bring the yeti back alive.

380
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:50,761
You have to promise me
he will not be harmed.

381
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:52,896
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

382
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:54,898
Captain, where did
that boat land?

383
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,399
Uh...

384
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:57,801
Yeah, Ma.

385
00:31:57,803 --> 00:32:00,670
Uh, Beijing is, um... is great.

386
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:03,507
And the dorms...
the dorms are clean.

387
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:04,908
Peng? Oh, Peng is, uh...

388
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,710
Look at all those teeth.

389
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:08,345
Peng's fine.

390
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:09,579
Hey, hey.

391
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:11,648
Oh, and Yi came, too.

392
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,383
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

393
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:15,352
She's, uh... she's checking out
the university.

394
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:16,787
Soda?

395
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:18,588
Oh, yeah!

396
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,390
Mom never lets me have any.

397
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:22,628
Catch!

398
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:31,701
Hey, Everest, come over here.

399
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:33,436
How long will we be here?

400
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,673
Oh, uh, excuse me.

401
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,575
Cafeteria food
is a little rich.

402
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:40,577
Well, I got to go, Ma. Bye.

403
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:43,947
I cannot believe that
you made me lie to my mother.

404
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:45,916
I love this stuff!

405
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:49,586
Hey, okay. Everest, look.

406
00:32:49,588 --> 00:32:53,456
First, you go over
the Yellow Mountain.

407
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,859
Then to the Yangtze River.

408
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:58,461
And that river will take you
most of the way

409
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:02,599
to the Himalayas,
and finally to Mount Everest.

410
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:04,601
This is how
you're going to get home.

411
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:05,869
Whoa, wait.

412
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:07,470
Mount Everest?
No, no, no.

413
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:08,939
That has to be
hundreds of miles away.

414
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:10,607
Actually, it's thousands.

415
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:14,446
I just hope he can make it
all that way.

416
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,817
He, um... he seems capable.

417
00:33:23,722 --> 00:33:26,890
Look at all those people.

418
00:33:26,892 --> 00:33:28,758
- Hello!
- Peng, get down!

419
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,493
Ow!

420
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,630
Yeah, we should hide.

421
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:49,613
Wait. Why are we still moving?

422
00:33:49,615 --> 00:33:51,815
Uh...

423
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:54,217
'cause we're not
at the dock anymore.

424
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:55,852
What?

425
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:58,655
No!

426
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:07,697
You know, I've never
been out of the city.

427
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:09,799
Wow. I can't believe
how beautiful

428
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,635
it is out here.

429
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,004
I can't believe
I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

430
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:15,739
I'm starving.

431
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:19,075
Uh-oh.

432
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:21,044
Guys, I got to go.

433
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:22,812
Just hold it.

434
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,251
Oh, no. He's got to go.

435
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:29,686
- Get me out of here!
- I can't.

436
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,890
Out of my way!

437
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:35,692
Got to go! Got to go!

438
00:34:35,694 --> 00:34:37,696
My head.

439
00:34:38,697 --> 00:34:40,063
- I'm good.
- Okay.

440
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:41,564
Come on.

441
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:43,633
Come on, come on, come on.

442
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:45,735
One bar.
Okay, that's good enough.

443
00:34:45,737 --> 00:34:47,771
- Good enough for what?
- To buy tickets home.

444
00:34:47,773 --> 00:34:50,006
Okay, look, the next boat
leaves around 5:00,

445
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:51,675
so let's hope
that's enough time

446
00:34:51,677 --> 00:34:53,576
to find our way back
to the dock.

447
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:55,545
Peng, come on. We're leaving.

448
00:34:55,547 --> 00:34:57,113
Yes, waiter.
I'm ready to order.

449
00:34:57,115 --> 00:35:00,784
I'll have some of Nai Nai's
pork buns with extra pork.

450
00:35:00,786 --> 00:35:02,886
All right, get up, Peng.
We got to go.

451
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:04,854
And a side of pork.

452
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,767
Is he...
Why is he making that...

453
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:19,970
- Shh, shh, shh. Jin.
- Is he humming?

454
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:24,741
What's going on?

455
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:26,310
Whoa.

456
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,549
What is happening?

457
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:35,752
Whoa. Is that a...

458
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,723
A blueberry?

459
00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:44,896
Food!

460
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:50,567
Guys, these are delicious.

461
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:52,569
That doesn't make any sense.

462
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:54,938
No, no, this is not possible.

463
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:58,041
It's not funny, all right?

464
00:35:58,043 --> 00:35:59,642
This is cashmere!

465
00:35:59,644 --> 00:36:01,811
Uh, Jin?

466
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:04,681
Now what?

467
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:06,182
Oh.

468
00:36:06,184 --> 00:36:09,886
Everest, do something.

469
00:36:12,624 --> 00:36:14,624
Run!

470
00:36:17,729 --> 00:36:18,795
Incoming!

471
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:24,801
- Run!
- Go faster!

472
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:29,172
Oh, no!

473
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:33,043
Save yourselves!

474
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:36,646
I'm hit!

475
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:38,815
Tell Nai Nai's pork buns
I love them.

476
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:57,002
Hey, Jin, did you get
enough to eat?

477
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,405
Let's just say I've got
blueberries in places

478
00:37:01,407 --> 00:37:04,007
where blueberries should never be.

479
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,144
Come on, Everest.

480
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:09,979
Okay.

481
00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:13,650
Watch and learn.

482
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:15,952
Bank shot.

483
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:21,925
- I'm exhausted.
- What?

484
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:23,726
Why are you stopping?

485
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:26,062
Because, in about five minutes,
we won't be able to see

486
00:37:26,064 --> 00:37:27,864
our hands
in front of our faces.

487
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:30,267
And that is exactly why
we've got to keep moving.

488
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:31,868
All right?
Come on, Peng.

489
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,870
We need to get back
to that dock.

490
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:37,240
First thing in the morning.

491
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:38,610
Yes!

492
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:46,250
There's so many.

493
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:48,118
- Bugs?
- Stars.

494
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,020
How come
they're only swarming me?

495
00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:52,755
Maybe they're ladybugs.

496
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:54,258
Lady... Not funny.

497
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,759
Well, my mom told me
that the stars

498
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:58,895
are our ancestors
who always watch over us.

499
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:02,765
My mom says that, too.

500
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:04,734
My backpack?

501
00:38:04,736 --> 00:38:06,903
Peng!

502
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:09,772
Oh, no, no, no, no!

503
00:38:09,774 --> 00:38:11,841
Great. No reception.

504
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:13,910
I'm entirely cut off
from my social life.

505
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:15,211
Mm. How traumatic.

506
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:16,913
Yeah, Yi, it is.

507
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:19,182
Because, unlike you,
I like having friends.

508
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:21,751
- I'm not some kind of a-a...
- Loner?

509
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:24,187
Is that what
you were gonna say?

510
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:28,091
Well, for your info,
I'm a self-proclaimed loner.

511
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:29,792
There's a difference, okay?

512
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:31,027
Fine, because in the morning,

513
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:33,196
Peng and I are headed back
to the city.

514
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:35,231
- I-I can't leave him.
- Yi.

515
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:37,301
You've seen what he can do.

516
00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:39,802
He's-he's amazing.

517
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:42,138
He's... he's magical.

518
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,275
Oh, so now he's a magical yeti.

519
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:46,343
Do you realize
how crazy you sound?

520
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:48,945
Look what happened
with the blueberries.

521
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:51,214
That wasn't him.
That was a natural phenomenon.

522
00:38:51,216 --> 00:38:54,050
Just one that
I can't explain yet.

523
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:57,820
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

524
00:38:57,822 --> 00:38:59,088
Go!

525
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:05,028
Hey, you cheated!

526
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:16,172
Will you two please
just give it a rest!

527
00:39:16,174 --> 00:39:18,841
Oh, my gosh, I'm beginning
to sound like my parents.

528
00:39:18,843 --> 00:39:20,810
That's it!

529
00:39:20,812 --> 00:39:22,979
That's why
they get along so well.

530
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:25,215
Everest is just a kid.

531
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,850
He's probably, like, the same
age as Peng but in yeti years.

532
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:30,220
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

533
00:39:30,222 --> 00:39:33,223
Right. There's no way
that giant thing is a kid.

534
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:34,958
Wait. I'll prove it to you.

535
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,193
Everest, come over here.

536
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:44,133
This is you.

537
00:39:45,571 --> 00:39:49,138
And your parents.

538
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,276
Aw. You have
your mother's eyes.

539
00:39:54,145 --> 00:39:56,313
Don't worry.
I will make sure you get home.

540
00:39:56,315 --> 00:39:58,014
What are you gonna do?

541
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:01,050
- Take him all the way back to Mount Everest?
- Maybe I am.

542
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:03,853
Jin, he needs to get back
to his family.

543
00:40:03,855 --> 00:40:06,423
And what about your family?
Don't they need you, too?

544
00:40:06,425 --> 00:40:08,359
Always busy, never home.

545
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:10,226
What's that all about, Yi?

546
00:40:10,228 --> 00:40:13,029
Don't talk to me about family.

547
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,964
You have no idea.

548
00:40:14,966 --> 00:40:17,033
No idea.
Your...

549
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:19,035
Your life is so easy, Jin.

550
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:21,204
Do you even... do you even
want to be a doctor,

551
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:22,872
or do you just think
that you'll...

552
00:40:22,874 --> 00:40:24,874
I don't know...
you'll look good in white?

553
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:27,910
All right.
Call me shallow all you want.

554
00:40:27,912 --> 00:40:29,313
At least I'm not delusional.

555
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,853
I don't care
if you think I'm crazy.

556
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:39,325
You're impossible.

557
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:01,781
Huh?

558
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:06,217
Is that Yi?

559
00:41:17,363 --> 00:41:20,264
Wait. Don't stop.
It's really good.

560
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:22,965
Your <i>nai nai</i> said you stopped
playing after your dad died.

561
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,100
Peng!

562
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:26,135
It's okay, Jin. Really.

563
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:28,104
Was this your dad's violin?

564
00:41:28,106 --> 00:41:29,440
Mm-hmm.

565
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:32,942
You know,
I really liked your dad.

566
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:34,245
Thanks, Peng.

567
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:38,147
Well, we better head out
if we're gonna

568
00:41:38,149 --> 00:41:39,483
make it to the Yangtze River.

569
00:41:39,485 --> 00:41:41,318
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

570
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,119
I checked,
and Dahe village has boats

571
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,488
leaving for the city
every hour.

572
00:41:45,957 --> 00:41:47,291
Okay, well, when we get there,

573
00:41:47,293 --> 00:41:49,926
you and Peng can take
a boat back, but...

574
00:41:49,928 --> 00:41:51,395
I'm going to take Everest home.

575
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:03,039
Well, that boat
pulled in yesterday morning,

576
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,275
but we've unloaded all of the
cargo and didn't find anyone.

577
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:09,145
Would you mind
if we search it again?

578
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:11,315
- You got anything?
- No, Captain.

579
00:42:11,317 --> 00:42:13,082
He was here?

580
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:14,418
Yes.

581
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,188
And it looks like
he fancies soda.

582
00:42:27,098 --> 00:42:29,165
Stop!

583
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,435
Down there.

584
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:34,139
What was that?

585
00:42:35,307 --> 00:42:36,740
Sorry, Doctor.

586
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:38,943
There's no sign
of them anywhere.

587
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:43,112
Sir, the yeti has disappeared.

588
00:42:43,114 --> 00:42:46,350
It has been so long
since I've been out in nature.

589
00:42:46,352 --> 00:42:48,519
- Sir, if we...
- Look at this tree.

590
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:51,053
It's a wonderful tree.

591
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:53,089
Look at the colors.

592
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,124
I love this tree.
You there, chop it down

593
00:42:55,126 --> 00:42:57,327
- and put it in a bag, will you?
- Right away, sir.

594
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:58,995
I want it in my penthouse...

595
00:42:58,997 --> 00:43:01,030
to be with me.

596
00:43:01,032 --> 00:43:03,467
- Mr. Burnish.
- Right. What? What is it?

597
00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:06,135
We should divide the team
and cover some ground.

598
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:09,406
Captain, let us fan out.

599
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:11,408
Yes, sir.

600
00:43:13,244 --> 00:43:15,077
Now, on the map, that village

601
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,380
is only, like,
a centimeter away.

602
00:43:16,382 --> 00:43:18,482
That can't be that far.

603
00:43:18,484 --> 00:43:20,451
It must just be
on the other side of the...

604
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,454
The Yellow Mountain.

605
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:29,593
- Wow.
- Wait. Wait.

606
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:32,228
We are not going over that.

607
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,465
Come on, Everest.
I'll race you.

608
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:44,575
Hey, you guys,
wait right there.

609
00:43:46,278 --> 00:43:48,545
Ooh. Everest, look.

610
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:50,447
Make a wish.

611
00:43:50,449 --> 00:43:53,250
No, no.
They're for wishing.

612
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:56,553
Leg cramp. Stop for a sec.

613
00:43:56,555 --> 00:43:59,523
Okay. I mean, if you
really need to.

614
00:44:02,628 --> 00:44:06,162
I wish I was
a basketball superstar.

615
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:11,268
Starting
in the championship game,

616
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,303
the mighty Peng!

617
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:20,611
Wait, is that a drone?
Cool!

618
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:24,581
Uh, okay.

619
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,584
- Not so cool. Not so cool.
- Oh, no.

620
00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:29,353
It's those guys from the city.

621
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:31,855
I told you
this was a crazy idea.

622
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:34,658
- Captain, I have footage.
- Copy that.

623
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,495
Those little thieves
stole my yeti.

624
00:44:38,497 --> 00:44:40,597
- Get us there.
- Keep your eyes on 'em.

625
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,165
- We're on our way.
- Uh, what now?

626
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:46,303
I wish there was
a way out of here.

627
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:51,475
Uh, what's going on?

628
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:53,477
- Whoa!
- Yi, let go of that.

629
00:44:53,479 --> 00:44:54,678
It's dangerous.

630
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,513
Everest, are you sure
about this?

631
00:44:56,515 --> 00:45:00,317
No! Peng!
Get down from there right now!

632
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,318
Hey, Peng!

633
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,185
- Jin, jump!
- Jump!

634
00:45:03,187 --> 00:45:05,322
No! Get down here!
Give me your hand!

635
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:06,657
Got you.

636
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:12,228
Meet me at that village
by the river!

637
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,431
- We'll be there!
- And take care of Peng!

638
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,602
Wow.

639
00:45:18,604 --> 00:45:20,537
Whoo! Whoa!

640
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,573
Yeah!

641
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,520
- Whoa!
- Everyone, push!

642
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:39,389
Uh-oh.

643
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,231
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

644
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:52,234
- Are you catching this?
- Is that a giant...

645
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:53,570
dandelion?

646
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:55,539
Giant dandelions?

647
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:58,575
Look, stop messing about
and get my yeti!

648
00:45:58,577 --> 00:46:00,546
Uh, yes, sir.
Let's take 'em down.

649
00:46:12,758 --> 00:46:14,391
Yeah!

650
00:46:14,393 --> 00:46:15,759
Take that, drones.

651
00:46:20,966 --> 00:46:23,567
So, who's going to tell
Mr. Burnish?

652
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:25,268
Not it!

653
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:27,537
- Help!
- Wait, where are we going?!

654
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:34,511
I hope you're not hurt.

655
00:46:34,513 --> 00:46:36,279
Let me introduce myself.

656
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:38,214
- I'm Dr. Zara.
- I know who you are.

657
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:39,483
You do?

658
00:46:39,485 --> 00:46:40,817
Yeah.

659
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:42,452
You're the bad guys.

660
00:46:42,454 --> 00:46:43,687
Aah!

661
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,422
Your gerbil is freaking me out.

662
00:46:45,424 --> 00:46:46,823
A boy that knows his gerbils.

663
00:46:46,825 --> 00:46:48,458
I like him.

664
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,827
Bad? Listen,
you've got this all wrong.

665
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:55,365
That wild beast is
unpredictable, even dangerous.

666
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:57,367
We were trying
to rescue your friend

667
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:58,769
when the yeti kidnapped her.

668
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:01,838
He did kidnap her.

669
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,740
Listen, you twit!

670
00:47:03,742 --> 00:47:06,242
I own that yeti.
He is my yeti.

671
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:07,811
I want my yeti back!

672
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:09,780
Right? Just nod.

673
00:47:09,782 --> 00:47:11,715
Mr. Burnish, please.

674
00:47:11,717 --> 00:47:13,717
Ow.

675
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:15,419
All right, look.

676
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:17,754
I-I just need to find my cousin
and my friend

677
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:20,023
and get 'em back
to the city in one piece.

678
00:47:20,025 --> 00:47:22,359
I can get all of you
back to the city,

679
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:24,461
but the only way
I can help your friends

680
00:47:24,463 --> 00:47:27,466
is if I know where they are.
Do you know?

681
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:32,302
That yeti is the pinnacle
of my research.

682
00:47:32,304 --> 00:47:35,672
I really need him back.

683
00:47:35,674 --> 00:47:38,608
I don't know where they are,

684
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,346
but I do know
where they will be.

685
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:51,888
Brace yourselves!

686
00:47:58,297 --> 00:48:00,731
Everest.

687
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:03,333
No, over here.

688
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:09,506
That was amazing, Everest.

689
00:48:09,508 --> 00:48:11,641
You saved us, and now we're...

690
00:48:11,643 --> 00:48:13,543
we're... we...

691
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:16,480
Where are we?

692
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:18,849
All I know is
we're a long way from Jin.

693
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:21,551
Yeah, well, that's his fault.
He should have jumped.

694
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:23,854
I mean, why...
why doesn't he ever just jump?

695
00:48:23,856 --> 00:48:26,823
He did. He jumped on that boat
back in the city.

696
00:48:26,825 --> 00:48:29,593
That's what got him on
this trip in the first place.

697
00:48:29,595 --> 00:48:31,661
Yeah, but that's because
he was worried about you.

698
00:48:31,663 --> 00:48:32,796
You're his family.

699
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:35,432
Yi, he thinks of you
as family, too.

700
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:37,634
Wh-What?

701
00:48:44,843 --> 00:48:48,345
Hey, little turtle.

702
00:48:48,347 --> 00:48:50,881
Everest, Jin said Yi
was like his little sister

703
00:48:50,883 --> 00:48:52,682
when they were kids.

704
00:48:52,684 --> 00:48:54,651
She was always doing
something crazy

705
00:48:54,653 --> 00:48:56,586
that would get her
into trouble,

706
00:48:56,588 --> 00:48:58,822
so he had to watch out for her.

707
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:01,827
And he still does.

708
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:07,631
I... I-I think
we should get going.

709
00:49:07,633 --> 00:49:10,667
But don't worry.
I can get us out of here.

710
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:12,437
Let's go.

711
00:49:13,972 --> 00:49:15,808
Put 'em down, Everest.

712
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:37,561
Suddenly, I saw it.

713
00:49:37,563 --> 00:49:40,730
A yeti. A real yeti.

714
00:49:40,732 --> 00:49:43,934
Cold eyes staring.

715
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:46,469
It tried to kill me!

716
00:49:46,471 --> 00:49:48,505
I needed to protect myself.

717
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:51,007
I swung my ice ax...

718
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:53,009
and it was gone.

719
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:54,878
No footprints.

720
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,613
Nothing.

721
00:49:56,615 --> 00:49:58,682
I rushed back to tell the world
what had happened,

722
00:49:58,684 --> 00:50:03,620
but without proof...
they laughed at me.

723
00:50:03,622 --> 00:50:06,756
They laughed at me.

724
00:50:06,758 --> 00:50:09,893
You spent all these years
trying to get your proof?

725
00:50:09,895 --> 00:50:11,895
Mm-hmm.

726
00:50:11,897 --> 00:50:16,967
I'm so used to
looking down on the world,

727
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:19,769
it's amazing
how small one feels

728
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:22,639
just by looking up.

729
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:25,508
Mr. Burnish, we need to get
an early start.

730
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,812
Thanks to Jin, we've learned
the yeti's whereabouts.

731
00:50:28,814 --> 00:50:31,982
Yes, yes.

732
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:34,484
Duchess... is that your name?

733
00:50:34,486 --> 00:50:35,886
You're kind of cute, you know,

734
00:50:35,888 --> 00:50:39,923
in your own ugly,
beady-eyed kind of way.

735
00:50:45,664 --> 00:50:48,531
I can't feel my feet.

736
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:50,967
"Don't worry.
I'll get us out of here."

737
00:50:50,969 --> 00:50:53,803
What was I thinking?

738
00:50:53,805 --> 00:50:55,872
We are completely lost.

739
00:50:55,874 --> 00:50:57,807
Everest is
nowhere near his mountain,

740
00:50:57,809 --> 00:50:59,542
and for all we know, Jin...

741
00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:01,745
Jin could be in trouble
right now, and it's...

742
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:04,614
It's all my fault.

743
00:51:06,518 --> 00:51:09,253
Jin said this trip was
a crazy idea, and...

744
00:51:09,255 --> 00:51:11,855
I don't know, maybe...
maybe he's right.

745
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:13,823
I mean, but...

746
00:51:13,825 --> 00:51:15,825
we could sure use him
right now.

747
00:51:15,827 --> 00:51:19,562
Yeah.
And the map on his cell phone.

748
00:51:21,099 --> 00:51:23,533
It's okay, Everest.
It's just a koi fish.

749
00:51:23,535 --> 00:51:25,001
That's weird.

750
00:51:25,003 --> 00:51:27,070
Why are they swimming
against the current?

751
00:51:27,072 --> 00:51:28,941
They're actually trying
to get back home.

752
00:51:30,676 --> 00:51:32,575
Ooh.

753
00:51:35,013 --> 00:51:36,947
Yeah, let's just put him back.

754
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:38,715
Do you think he'll make it?

755
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:40,850
Well, he's sure gonna try.

756
00:51:40,852 --> 00:51:43,086
You know these fish are
the symbol of perseverance?

757
00:51:43,088 --> 00:51:44,587
What?

758
00:51:46,058 --> 00:51:48,124
It's, uh... it's just
something my mom told me.

759
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:51,863
It means that,
when things get really tough...

760
00:51:53,565 --> 00:51:55,098
...they never give up.

761
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,666
You know what, guys?

762
00:51:56,668 --> 00:51:58,101
We have to keep going.
Come on.

763
00:51:58,103 --> 00:51:59,736
Come on, you guys, let's go.

764
00:52:00,872 --> 00:52:02,507
Everest, put the fish down.

765
00:52:03,742 --> 00:52:06,044
Into the water.

766
00:52:22,928 --> 00:52:26,330
- Ow.
- Get back, you abominable creature.

767
00:52:26,332 --> 00:52:27,797
Back!

768
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,608
That's great. Of course.

769
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,744
He said in
the sweetest little voice,

770
00:52:40,746 --> 00:52:44,147
"You're cute in your own ugly,
beady-eyed kind of way."

771
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:47,917
I tell you, he's going soft.

772
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:49,953
We need to act fast.
If that kid is right

773
00:52:49,955 --> 00:52:52,022
and we find the yeti
at the river tomorrow,

774
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:54,991
use any means possible
to take him down.

775
00:52:54,993 --> 00:52:57,127
I thought we had to keep
the yeti alive.

776
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:59,729
The buyer won't pay us
unless he's still breathing,

777
00:52:59,731 --> 00:53:01,664
but if he's a little banged up,
who cares?

778
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,733
They're just gonna chop him up
into little pieces

779
00:53:03,735 --> 00:53:05,369
for their experiments anyway.

780
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:07,670
Well, what do we do
with the kids?

781
00:53:07,672 --> 00:53:08,972
If you want your ten percent,

782
00:53:08,974 --> 00:53:10,807
you'll get rid of them...
for good!

783
00:53:12,677 --> 00:53:15,011
Oh, and get rid of this rodent
I've been carrying around.

784
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:17,147
Do you know
how hard it is to keep up

785
00:53:17,149 --> 00:53:18,948
this British animal-lover act?

786
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,016
I'm done!

787
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:23,953
Duchess? But she's
a one-of-a-kind albino jerboa.

788
00:53:23,955 --> 00:53:26,122
She's just a rat, you idiot!

789
00:53:26,124 --> 00:53:28,126
Hey. My keys.

790
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:39,037
Here. I think you're
better off with this guy.

791
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,976
Mmm. Not now.

792
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,846
All right, let's see.

793
00:53:49,848 --> 00:53:51,716
SUV? Too loud.

794
00:53:53,419 --> 00:53:55,153
Transporter? No.

795
00:53:56,822 --> 00:53:58,255
What's this one?

796
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,194
Sweet.

797
00:54:04,696 --> 00:54:05,929
Check the hair.

798
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:07,197
Looking good, Jin.

799
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,065
Thanks, Jin.

800
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:11,002
All right, let's do this.

801
00:54:15,107 --> 00:54:16,108
Oh!

802
00:54:35,961 --> 00:54:38,262
It's okay, babies.
It's okay. I got you.

803
00:55:05,991 --> 00:55:08,793
Nope. Nope.
I can't do it.

804
00:55:09,861 --> 00:55:12,095
All right, fine, just take it!

805
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:19,068
Be the koi fish.

806
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,904
Be the koi fish.

807
00:55:20,906 --> 00:55:23,006
That's it, Peng.

808
00:55:23,008 --> 00:55:24,774
You keep swimming.

809
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:27,744
What was that?

810
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:30,079
Come on!

811
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:31,915
All right!

812
00:55:31,917 --> 00:55:33,783
No more swimming!

813
00:55:33,785 --> 00:55:35,985
Yeah, but how
are we gonna catch it?

814
00:55:50,769 --> 00:55:53,304
Whoo-hoo!

815
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:59,042
Now, this is the way to travel.

816
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:00,944
Ready, Everest?

817
00:56:04,149 --> 00:56:05,848
Again.

818
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,917
You know, Everest, I...

819
00:56:07,919 --> 00:56:09,986
I can't figure you out.

820
00:56:09,988 --> 00:56:12,121
I mean, how...
how do you do that?

821
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:14,123
Ah.

822
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:17,294
Maybe it's his gift,
like when you play the violin

823
00:56:17,296 --> 00:56:19,330
or when I play basketball.

824
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:22,031
Everest talks to nature.

825
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:25,001
Now, that... that is a gift.

826
00:56:46,392 --> 00:56:49,260
- Well, this is the village.
- Do you see Jin?

827
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:52,161
Through that mob?
Are you kidding me?

828
00:56:52,163 --> 00:56:54,298
- We need to both look for him.
- What about Everest?

829
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,300
- Move it, yaks.
- Oh.

830
00:56:56,302 --> 00:56:57,601
Got an idea.

831
00:56:57,603 --> 00:57:00,069
Grab all of that rope.

832
00:57:09,014 --> 00:57:10,614
Can you see anything?

833
00:57:10,616 --> 00:57:11,914
Nope.

834
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:14,217
Yi, there he is!

835
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:16,453
Jin! Jin!

836
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:18,322
We're gonna lose him.

837
00:57:18,324 --> 00:57:21,092
I'll run ahead.
Stay there and blend in.

838
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:25,228
Oh, your yak is odd-looking.

839
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:28,332
Hey, don't body-shame my yak.

840
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:29,932
Jin! Jin!

841
00:57:31,136 --> 00:57:32,469
- Yes?
- Whoa.

842
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:34,806
I am so sorry.

843
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,241
No.

844
00:57:38,243 --> 00:57:39,310
Keep looking.

845
00:57:39,312 --> 00:57:40,910
He said they would be here.

846
00:57:40,912 --> 00:57:42,881
I can't believe
he crashed my bike.

847
00:57:44,115 --> 00:57:45,416
Look!

848
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,949
Target spotted.
Move out.

849
00:57:48,987 --> 00:57:51,255
They found us. Let's go.

850
00:57:51,257 --> 00:57:52,656
Go!

851
00:57:52,658 --> 00:57:54,658
Go, Everest, go! Move it!

852
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,361
- No. Oh, no.
- Hey, you.

853
00:57:57,363 --> 00:57:58,895
Need a ride?

854
00:57:58,897 --> 00:58:01,398
Jin?

855
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,000
- You showed up.
- Of course I did.

856
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:05,968
Wait. Where's Peng?

857
00:58:07,373 --> 00:58:09,074
Everest!

858
00:58:11,242 --> 00:58:12,909
Oh, no.

859
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:16,112
Coming in at four-foot-ten
and ready to take the game,

860
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:18,482
the mighty Peng!

861
00:58:20,218 --> 00:58:21,984
High five! Yeah!

862
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,430
- Everest! Peng!
- Peng, come on!

863
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:34,999
Jin, I knew you'd be here.

864
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:37,967
Good to see you, coz.

865
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:39,403
What happened to your babies?

866
00:58:39,405 --> 00:58:42,071
Well, Peng...

867
00:58:42,073 --> 00:58:44,375
my babies are all grown-up.

868
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:46,142
Hang on.

869
00:58:48,012 --> 00:58:50,179
Captain, don't you dare
let them get away!

870
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:53,250
Hold on. This little lady has
a few tricks up her sleeve.

871
00:59:05,531 --> 00:59:07,398
Go faster!

872
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,165
I'm trying!

873
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:11,236
Everest, do something.

874
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:19,008
- Hurry, Everest.
- Whoa.

875
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,513
- It's working.
- Uh...

876
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:24,013
Oh, no.

877
00:59:24,015 --> 00:59:25,416
Guys? Guys!

878
00:59:25,418 --> 00:59:28,419
- Turn! Turn, turn, turn!
- Turn! Turn!

879
00:59:35,261 --> 00:59:37,195
Ow!

880
00:59:42,435 --> 00:59:44,501
Whoa.

881
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:47,337
This is unbelievable.

882
00:59:49,073 --> 00:59:50,507
Peng, Peng, look.

883
00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:52,208
It's okay.

884
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,210
Wow!

885
00:59:54,212 --> 00:59:57,148
Whoo-hoo!

886
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:03,219
Whoa!

887
01:00:03,221 --> 01:00:05,221
This is amazing!

888
01:00:05,223 --> 01:00:06,457
This is impossible.

889
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:08,492
Come on, Everest.

890
01:00:08,494 --> 01:00:10,494
Make it go bigger!

891
01:00:10,496 --> 01:00:13,397
Ooh. Whoa!

892
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:14,531
Whoa!

893
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:16,500
Higher!

894
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,369
Okay. Okay, that's enough.

895
01:00:19,371 --> 01:00:22,372
- Slow down!
- Peng!

896
01:00:22,374 --> 01:00:23,540
Slow down!

897
01:00:34,653 --> 01:00:37,387
- Peng!
- Where is he?

898
01:00:42,828 --> 01:00:45,395
Peng?

899
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:53,537
Oh, no.

900
01:00:53,539 --> 01:00:56,406
Everest, no. Everest.

901
01:00:56,408 --> 01:00:57,541
Hold it in.

902
01:00:57,543 --> 01:00:59,345
No, no!

903
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:05,249
Hey, Jin.

904
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:07,520
You got a little something
right here.

905
01:01:19,265 --> 01:01:20,533
No.

906
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:23,433
Oh, no.

907
01:01:23,435 --> 01:01:25,302
No.

908
01:01:25,304 --> 01:01:27,169
No. No.

909
01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:32,311
Yi?

910
01:01:52,364 --> 01:01:54,431
You okay?

911
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:59,336
Yeah, um...

912
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:04,343
that violin meant
everything to me.

913
01:02:07,178 --> 01:02:08,478
When we were little,

914
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,615
you know my dad used to play
all the time.

915
01:02:11,617 --> 01:02:14,216
Um...

916
01:02:14,218 --> 01:02:17,219
but every night,
when he was tucking me in,

917
01:02:17,221 --> 01:02:21,358
he would play this one song
just for me.

918
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,527
And...

919
01:02:23,529 --> 01:02:26,763
I don't know, it-it made me
feel like everything...

920
01:02:26,765 --> 01:02:29,633
was gonna be okay.

921
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:34,538
Yi, I'm sorry.

922
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,239
I'm-I'm sorry for what I said.

923
01:02:37,241 --> 01:02:39,175
Too busy, never home. I...

924
01:02:39,177 --> 01:02:41,311
No. No, no, no, you-you're...
you're right.

925
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:43,747
I... I know I keep busy.

926
01:02:43,749 --> 01:02:46,283
I just... I don't know why.

927
01:02:46,285 --> 01:02:48,752
I mean, I... I-I...

928
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:53,590
I miss him, and I don't want
to miss him, but...

929
01:02:53,592 --> 01:02:56,526
I haven't even cried yet, Jin.

930
01:02:56,528 --> 01:03:00,764
And my family,
we're all so distant, and I...

931
01:03:00,766 --> 01:03:02,666
I don't know.

932
01:03:02,668 --> 01:03:05,769
I don't... I-I...
I don't know what to do.

933
01:03:05,771 --> 01:03:09,708
Well, are you sure they're
the ones who are distant?

934
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:16,580
But you were right
about me, too.

935
01:03:16,582 --> 01:03:19,449
Yeah, hate to admit it,
but, I mean, that thought

936
01:03:19,451 --> 01:03:21,551
about looking good
in the white doctor's coat,

937
01:03:21,553 --> 01:03:23,687
it did cross my mind.

938
01:03:23,689 --> 01:03:26,556
I am a horrible,
horrible person.

939
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:30,694
Yeah, you are the worst.

940
01:03:30,696 --> 01:03:33,229
I really... I am.

941
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,566
Yi, listen.

942
01:03:36,568 --> 01:03:40,236
If those people find Everest,
we're all in danger.

943
01:03:40,238 --> 01:03:44,841
Wait, do... do they know
where I'm taking him?

944
01:03:44,843 --> 01:03:46,843
They are headed
to the Himalayas, sir.

945
01:03:46,845 --> 01:03:48,845
And the yeti's powers
will grow even stronger

946
01:03:48,847 --> 01:03:51,448
the closer he gets
to those mountains.

947
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:54,351
But there's still one more
chance to capture your yeti.

948
01:03:54,353 --> 01:03:57,621
At the foothills of those
mountains, there's a bridge.

949
01:03:57,623 --> 01:04:01,391
Once the yeti crosses it,
he'll blend in, disappear.

950
01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:03,326
We will never find him again.

951
01:04:03,328 --> 01:04:06,363
I've never seen powers
like those before.

952
01:04:06,365 --> 01:04:08,832
It's intimidating.

953
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:10,567
Stay the course, sir.

954
01:04:10,569 --> 01:04:15,539
After this, no one will ever
laugh at you again.

955
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:17,340
You're right.

956
01:04:17,342 --> 01:04:20,277
Captain, we are going to need
reinforcements.

957
01:04:20,279 --> 01:04:22,846
Lots... of reinforcements.

958
01:04:22,848 --> 01:04:24,481
Yes, sir.

959
01:04:24,483 --> 01:04:27,584
What do those powers
mean for us?

960
01:04:27,586 --> 01:04:30,620
That yeti's
price tag just doubled.

961
01:04:30,622 --> 01:04:32,589
Hey, you guys,
did you find that thing?

962
01:04:32,591 --> 01:04:34,424
We're working on it.

963
01:04:34,426 --> 01:04:36,626
- There it is.
- There it is.

964
01:04:36,628 --> 01:04:38,628
♪ There it is. ♪

965
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,697
Really, Dave?

966
01:04:45,604 --> 01:04:47,504
Come on. Come quickly.

967
01:04:47,506 --> 01:04:49,608
Everest?

968
01:04:51,777 --> 01:04:54,377
You okay?

969
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:01,885
- Is that...
- Yeti hair?

970
01:05:01,887 --> 01:05:03,386
Yep.

971
01:05:09,461 --> 01:05:11,928
See?

972
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:14,664
It's as good as new.

973
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:16,666
No.

974
01:05:16,668 --> 01:05:18,902
It's better than new.

975
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:29,412
Hey. When did you buy these?

976
01:05:29,414 --> 01:05:31,548
Oh, I-I-I didn't buy them.

977
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,351
They were my dad's.

978
01:05:34,353 --> 01:05:36,353
He kept postcards
of all the places

979
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:38,121
he wanted to take us someday.

980
01:05:38,123 --> 01:05:39,956
The... the whole family.

981
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:42,728
Yi, they're all of the places
we've been.

982
01:05:46,632 --> 01:05:49,399
What?

983
01:05:49,401 --> 01:05:51,568
No way. What... How...

984
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,570
How is this possible?

985
01:05:53,572 --> 01:05:54,838
That can't be.

986
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,507
We've been to all of these.

987
01:05:57,509 --> 01:05:59,778
All but one.

988
01:06:06,819 --> 01:06:09,588
The Leshan Buddha.

989
01:06:11,423 --> 01:06:15,158
This is the place that my dad
wanted me to see the most.

990
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,162
This... this is incredible.

991
01:06:19,164 --> 01:06:21,698
You brought me here,
didn't you?

992
01:06:23,402 --> 01:06:25,936
Whoa.

993
01:06:25,938 --> 01:06:27,940
Impossible.

994
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:55,767
Whoa.

995
01:07:09,514 --> 01:07:11,882
Wow.

996
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:15,654
I wish Dad were here
to see this.

997
01:09:16,675 --> 01:09:18,074
It's beautiful.

998
01:09:18,076 --> 01:09:20,610
Thank you, Everest.

999
01:09:22,848 --> 01:09:25,882
You did that, Yi. You did.

1000
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:30,620
I did that?

1001
01:09:34,092 --> 01:09:36,092
Whoa.

1002
01:09:37,696 --> 01:09:38,995
Come on, Everest.

1003
01:09:38,997 --> 01:09:40,799
Yi.

1004
01:09:44,036 --> 01:09:47,739
We are so going
to the Himalayas.

1005
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:57,947
Come on, you guys.

1006
01:09:57,949 --> 01:09:58,982
Whoa, whoa!

1007
01:09:58,984 --> 01:10:00,817
Okay, okay!

1008
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:18,868
Hold on, Peng. Whoo-hoo!

1009
01:10:58,777 --> 01:11:00,110
Come on. If we keep going,

1010
01:11:00,112 --> 01:11:02,078
we'll get to the Himalayas
by morning.

1011
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,048
Those guys are not gonna stop
until they get... Everest!

1012
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,684
Is that better?

1013
01:11:07,686 --> 01:11:09,986
Maybe.

1014
01:11:09,988 --> 01:11:11,754
We still have to
keep going, though.

1015
01:11:11,756 --> 01:11:13,156
I know.

1016
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,160
Will it be the same?

1017
01:11:17,162 --> 01:11:20,029
You know,
when Everest goes home?

1018
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:22,031
With us, I mean.

1019
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:24,234
Like, will you guys
still want to hang out?

1020
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:27,036
Of course we will, Peng.

1021
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:30,773
You know, I'll sure miss
seeing these stars.

1022
01:11:30,775 --> 01:11:32,276
Yeah, but even though
we can't see them,

1023
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:34,144
we'll still know they're there.

1024
01:11:34,146 --> 01:11:36,045
So, that's kind of cool,
isn't it?

1025
01:11:36,047 --> 01:11:39,182
Yes, Peng, that's very cool.

1026
01:11:46,057 --> 01:11:47,491
It's not funny.

1027
01:11:47,493 --> 01:11:49,792
Loch Ness Monster?
Chupacabra?

1028
01:11:49,794 --> 01:11:51,961
I mean, what if they exist?

1029
01:11:51,963 --> 01:11:54,864
Oh, my gosh.
My whole life has been a lie.

1030
01:12:00,805 --> 01:12:03,106
Wow. The Himalayas.

1031
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:07,511
- Whoa.
- Awesome!

1032
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:09,179
Everest, look.

1033
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:11,315
Just across that bridge
is home.

1034
01:12:11,317 --> 01:12:14,751
What are we waiting for?
Let's go, let's go!

1035
01:12:18,957 --> 01:12:22,093
Everest! Wait up!

1036
01:12:27,165 --> 01:12:29,799
Oh, no.

1037
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:34,137
Go! Go back!

1038
01:12:34,139 --> 01:12:35,807
Whoa!

1039
01:12:38,843 --> 01:12:40,109
Go, go, go!

1040
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:47,083
Whoa!

1041
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:51,888
Everest, run!

1042
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:55,060
Go to your mountain now,
before it's too late.

1043
01:12:56,094 --> 01:12:57,193
Captain, hurry.

1044
01:12:57,195 --> 01:12:59,396
Get my yeti! Get him now!

1045
01:13:01,866 --> 01:13:04,067
No, no, no, no, no, no,
you're going the wrong way!

1046
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:05,935
He's on the move!

1047
01:13:37,436 --> 01:13:40,103
It's amazing.

1048
01:13:40,105 --> 01:13:42,071
Mr. Burnish,
we're missing our chance.

1049
01:13:42,073 --> 01:13:43,975
Load tranq guns.

1050
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,976
Wait! Hold your fire!

1051
01:13:57,222 --> 01:13:59,055
Get back!

1052
01:14:08,233 --> 01:14:10,099
<i>Mr. Burnish!</i>

1053
01:14:10,101 --> 01:14:12,469
Take the shot!

1054
01:14:14,072 --> 01:14:15,272
Oh, no.

1055
01:14:15,274 --> 01:14:18,107
He's defending them.

1056
01:14:18,109 --> 01:14:19,343
Mr. Burnish.

1057
01:14:19,345 --> 01:14:22,180
Mr. Burnish!

1058
01:14:23,649 --> 01:14:26,015
Doctor, I was wrong.

1059
01:14:26,017 --> 01:14:28,217
You were right.

1060
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:30,354
The yeti must be protected,

1061
01:14:30,356 --> 01:14:34,957
and the best way to protect
the yeti is to let him go.

1062
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:39,128
We must let him go.

1063
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:41,498
Captain, order your men
to stow their weapons.

1064
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,835
Do it now!

1065
01:14:48,474 --> 01:14:50,274
Hmm.

1066
01:14:50,276 --> 01:14:52,476
Quick!
Mr. Burnish needs help.

1067
01:14:57,215 --> 01:14:58,818
Captain.

1068
01:15:03,389 --> 01:15:04,521
Fire at will.

1069
01:15:04,523 --> 01:15:06,155
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire!

1070
01:15:17,403 --> 01:15:18,903
Everest!

1071
01:15:29,281 --> 01:15:31,013
- No!
- Get the kids! Go!

1072
01:15:31,015 --> 01:15:33,015
- Everest!
- No! No!

1073
01:15:33,017 --> 01:15:35,218
- Stop! Stop!
- Everest!

1074
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,267
I'll make sure the yeti's out.

1075
01:15:50,269 --> 01:15:52,034
No! No!

1076
01:15:53,972 --> 01:15:56,172
You are never going
to escape again.

1077
01:15:56,174 --> 01:15:57,441
Wait, wait, get her!

1078
01:15:57,443 --> 01:15:59,376
Stop it!

1079
01:15:59,378 --> 01:16:02,312
- Yi!
- Yi!

1080
01:16:16,762 --> 01:16:19,329
- No! No! No!
- Yi! No!

1081
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:22,299
- Well, that's one down.
- Yi!

1082
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:24,000
- All right, move out.
- Yes, sir.

1083
01:16:24,002 --> 01:16:25,234
Copy that. Moving out.

1084
01:16:25,236 --> 01:16:26,470
- Yes, Captain.
- Go back! No!

1085
01:16:26,472 --> 01:16:28,272
- Go back! Yi!
- Yi!

1086
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:30,340
Stop the car!

1087
01:18:34,533 --> 01:18:36,266
It's Everest.

1088
01:18:36,268 --> 01:18:37,634
No, this can't be happening!

1089
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,473
- Let's go! - Go, go!
- I'm out of here!

1090
01:18:43,475 --> 01:18:44,641
Sir. Sir, wake up.

1091
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,379
Yi! You're okay.

1092
01:18:49,381 --> 01:18:51,180
Everest!

1093
01:18:55,721 --> 01:18:58,555
I thought we had
to keep the yeti alive.

1094
01:18:58,557 --> 01:19:01,192
Dead will have to do.

1095
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:04,263
No!

1096
01:19:06,332 --> 01:19:07,666
Yes!

1097
01:19:10,636 --> 01:19:12,404
Uh...

1098
01:19:20,512 --> 01:19:22,314
No!

1099
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:25,616
Everest?

1100
01:19:36,227 --> 01:19:37,494
Everest?

1101
01:19:45,337 --> 01:19:47,371
Everest?

1102
01:19:47,373 --> 01:19:49,272
You are by far the most
extraordinary creature

1103
01:19:49,274 --> 01:19:51,375
I have ever seen.

1104
01:19:51,377 --> 01:19:54,311
That is exactly why
the world...

1105
01:19:54,313 --> 01:19:57,148
must never know you exist.

1106
01:19:58,651 --> 01:20:00,517
They would not understand.

1107
01:20:00,519 --> 01:20:01,818
I didn't.

1108
01:20:04,456 --> 01:20:07,324
Now, can I please help you
get back to the city?

1109
01:20:07,326 --> 01:20:09,326
Thank you, but...

1110
01:20:09,328 --> 01:20:11,595
I promised
to take Everest home,

1111
01:20:11,597 --> 01:20:13,597
and he's not home yet.

1112
01:20:13,599 --> 01:20:15,832
You're going to take Everest
all the way to Everest?

1113
01:20:15,834 --> 01:20:18,301
That is impossible.

1114
01:20:18,303 --> 01:20:19,569
Sir, with all due respect,

1115
01:20:19,571 --> 01:20:21,605
when Yi sets her mind
on something,

1116
01:20:21,607 --> 01:20:23,640
nothing is impossible.

1117
01:20:23,642 --> 01:20:26,276
Yes.

1118
01:20:26,278 --> 01:20:27,479
It's cold.

1119
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,614
But there is something

1120
01:20:30,616 --> 01:20:33,717
I have to insist
that I give you.

1121
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:35,719
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- See you later.

1122
01:20:35,721 --> 01:20:37,454
Don't worry.

1123
01:20:37,456 --> 01:20:39,523
I'll be waiting right here.

1124
01:20:39,525 --> 01:20:42,659
They just wanted
our coats, Dave.

1125
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:47,332
Guys, it sure is
a long way up there.

1126
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:51,501
Everest?

1127
01:21:03,615 --> 01:21:05,782
- Cool!
- All right.

1128
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:07,417
Bring it!

1129
01:21:15,527 --> 01:21:16,693
Wow.

1130
01:21:31,844 --> 01:21:33,512
Yeah!

1131
01:21:37,683 --> 01:21:38,815
Whoa!

1132
01:22:02,508 --> 01:22:05,342
Everest, it's your mountain.

1133
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,723
What do we do now?

1134
01:22:19,725 --> 01:22:21,558
I don't know.

1135
01:22:39,578 --> 01:22:42,314
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1136
01:22:50,956 --> 01:22:53,590
His parents.

1137
01:22:53,592 --> 01:22:54,891
Wow.

1138
01:22:54,893 --> 01:22:57,727
They'd be so good
at basketball.

1139
01:23:06,705 --> 01:23:09,773
We're finally home, Everest.

1140
01:23:09,775 --> 01:23:12,611
Home.

1141
01:23:16,415 --> 01:23:17,881
I can't...

1142
01:23:17,883 --> 01:23:19,783
I can't believe
the journey's over.

1143
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:41,907
You're right.

1144
01:23:43,775 --> 01:23:45,744
It's not over.

1145
01:23:48,647 --> 01:23:50,547
Thank you, Everest.

1146
01:23:53,485 --> 01:23:56,219
I'll never forget you, Everest!

1147
01:25:04,623 --> 01:25:06,089
Goodbye.

1148
01:25:06,091 --> 01:25:08,727
Bye. Thank you.

1149
01:25:21,974 --> 01:25:23,974
- Ma?
- Yi?

1150
01:25:23,976 --> 01:25:25,742
You're back.

1151
01:25:25,744 --> 01:25:27,610
How was the trip?

1152
01:25:27,612 --> 01:25:28,712
Aw.

1153
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:32,684
Yi?

1154
01:25:33,919 --> 01:25:36,152
I missed you both so much.

1155
01:25:36,154 --> 01:25:40,525
It's good to have you back,
granddaughter.

1156
01:25:42,027 --> 01:25:44,561
Why don't you get that?

1157
01:25:44,563 --> 01:25:46,730
It's probably the boys.

1158
01:25:46,732 --> 01:25:49,799
Who is ready
for Nai Nai's pork buns?

1159
01:25:49,801 --> 01:25:51,634
Look what I found
on your doorstep.

1160
01:25:51,636 --> 01:25:53,103
- It's addressed to all of us.
- Shh!

1161
01:25:53,105 --> 01:25:54,740
Come over here.

1162
01:25:58,577 --> 01:26:00,944
<i>For your next adventure.</i>

1163
01:26:00,946 --> 01:26:02,912
Hey, kids, how was Beijing?

1164
01:26:02,914 --> 01:26:03,947
Peng!

1165
01:26:03,949 --> 01:26:05,949
Oh, it was, um, life-changing.

1166
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:07,917
Wow. That's great.

1167
01:26:07,919 --> 01:26:09,621
Everybody, dig in.

1168
01:26:11,156 --> 01:26:13,123
Mmm. Wow.

1169
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:16,126
You know, I totally see what
you mean about these pork buns.

1170
01:26:16,128 --> 01:26:17,894
Uh-huh.

1171
01:26:17,896 --> 01:26:19,662
There is no one in the world

1172
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:21,998
who likes these pork buns
more than me.

1173
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,070
Well... maybe one.

1174
01:26:26,671 --> 01:26:27,937
Who?

1175
01:26:27,939 --> 01:26:29,672
Who else like my buns?

1176
01:26:31,043 --> 01:26:34,077
- No laughing. I'm serious.
- Oh, Nai Nai.

1177
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:51,920
