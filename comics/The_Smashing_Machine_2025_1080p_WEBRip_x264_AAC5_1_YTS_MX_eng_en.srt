<i>to ever step into this ring,</i>

about my cardiovascular level.

152

it's like the difference

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,060
between a flashlight
and a laser beam.

156
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,720
Wow.

157
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,960
That's awesome.
What do you mean by that?

158
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,630

160
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,870
Because if not,
then my emotions

161

will be running
around everywhere,

our fears and our anxieties
will get the best of us.

Is that boxing?

Well, there's
a little boxing in it. Yeah.

227

from a wrestling background,

231

who comes
from a karate background

That's right, it is.

But I gotta tell you,
the popularity of the sport

238
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,290
comes from the stereotype
that you're gonna see

with this over here?

01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,140
-What do you mean?
-I asked you to

01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,170
prune the bottom
so the tops will get bigger.

Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize

1259
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,150
it was such a big deal.

leading to
a championship fight

that we disappointed the fans

1421
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:13,540
last time with the cancelation
of the main card

1422

of Enson Inoue
versus Mark Kerr.

that this will not
happen again.

for some time

1426
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,120
to address his Japanese fans

1427
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:32,060
regarding his inclusion
in this special tournament.

1428

Hello.

And thank you to everyone

1430

for allowing me
to be here today.

1431
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:47,340
I'd like to apologize,
first and foremost,

1432
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,280
to the Pride organization
and staff.

1433
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:56,180
You have been
extremely understanding to me

1434
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,720
during my time of dealing
with my personal struggles,

1435
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,830
and finally to
the Japanese people,

1436

1437
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,930
I know that
you've been questioning

1438
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:15,130
whether I am the fighter
that you thought that I was.

1439
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:21,510
And one of
my biggest regrets in life

1440
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:23,740
is the answer
to that question.

1441
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:26,680
I wasn't.

1442

And I'm ashamed about that.

that I'm gonna work
even harder

all your weapons away.

on his striking
and his kicking.

1460

Promoters told him
that they don't want to see

any more grappling
and wrestling.

knockouts.

get knocked out.

he beat Ricardo.

1465

is gonna do exactly

-the same thing to you.
-Yeah.

and he wants to knock you out.

shoot in, take his ass down,

1472

in the face, I guess.

-So, no striking?
-No, no striking.

1474

Well, you need
to know striking

1475
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,550
in order to get him to tire
to take him to the ground.

But, come on, man,

1477

you know his game plan, right?

1478
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:21,060
Five wins by knockout,
five wins by submission.

It's gonna be
a super exciting fight

1602
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,960
and I'll tell you why.
Because last time,

1603
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,770
Mark Kerr wasn't
in the best shape.

1604

he came back to me.

once you acquire the skill set
of mixed martial arts,

1607
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,270
I think that endurance

1608
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:47,740
is the most important aspect
of mixed martial arts.

1609

01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:34,030
They just called you
out of the blue?

1846
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:35,470
Dawn, I have a big fight
in a couple of weeks.

1847
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:38,340
They're probably just calling
to see how I feel about it.

1848
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,540
(CHUCKLES, CLEARS THROAT)

1849
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:43,080
Makes sense.

1850
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:58,760
So they weren't calling
to make sure you wouldn't cave

1851
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,460
and bring me
to Japan with you?

1852
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,160
You listened to
my answering machine?

1853
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:04,300
Yeah, I did.
I did because I'm not hearing

1854
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,100
shit from you.
So, do you agree with them?

1855
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:08,370
What are you
talking about, Dawn?

1856
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:10,500
Say it. That you don't want me
to go with you to Japan.

1857
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,140
-I'm not gonna say that, Dawn.
-Why? Just say it.

1858
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,940
I'm just... I just need, like,
a couple of days. That's it.

1859
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,140
I just need two days.
That's it.

1860
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:18,840
Just to focus.

1861
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:20,210
You're saying
I can't help you focus?

1862
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:21,480
No, I'm not saying
that at all.

1863
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:22,610
I'm just saying, Dawn,

1864
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,520
I need you to understand,
this is a big deal for me.

1865
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:26,120
It's the biggest fight ever.

1866
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,920
I just need a couple of days.
That's it.

1867
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,560
Just a couple of days
to focus.

1868
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:30,990
Bas is saying I just need it

1869
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:33,030
-without any distractions.
-I got it, I got it, I got it.

1870
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:41,630
You know what?
I don't fucking get it.

1871
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,270
-What don't you get, Dawn?
-I don't fucking get it

1872
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:45,340
because I do everything
for you around here, okay?

1873
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,170
I book your appointments,
I cook for you,

1874
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:48,510
I clean your
fucking underwear.

1875
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:49,510
-I know you do.
-And I'm

1876
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:50,780
-the big fucking distraction?
-No, you're not.

1877
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,910
I've thanked you in the past,

1878
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:53,710
and I appreciate
everything you do.

1879
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:54,950
This is a crazy tournament.

1880
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:56,550
This is the biggest fight
of my life.

1881
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,750
Just say
you don't want me to go.

1882
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:59,920
I'm not gonna say that to you.
It confuses the situation.

1883
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:01,090
Yeah, I want you to say it
to me. There's nothing

1884
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:02,490
-confusing about it.
-I'm not gonna say that.

1885
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:04,320
You just look me in the eye
and you tell me you hate me,

1886
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:05,920
-and you don't want me to go.
-What the fuck are you...

1887
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:07,860
I'm not gonna say that.
I'm not gonna say that.

1888
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,030
And how many times
do I have to rewrite

1889
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:10,660
-my boundaries with you?
-I don't want you to

1890
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:11,900
-rewrite...
-This is so fucking

1891
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
-exhausting. Please, Dawn.
-I'm sorry, I just...

1892

Mark, I just need you
to let me in.

1893
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,740
I feel so excluded
from everything.

1894

And I'd love to know
about your fighting.

1895
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:21,070
And I'd love to know
about your training,

1896

how you're feeling
in your body,

1897
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:23,180
but you don't want to tell me.

1898
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,410
-Holy shit!
-Dawn, don't do that.

1899
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:27,480
Do not do that.
Don't act like all of a sudden

1900
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:30,080
you give two shits
about my body and my training,

1901
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,580
when the only thing
you care about is yourself.

1902
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,650
Really?

1903

Inserting yourself
into everything.

1904
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:35,020
Yes, that's it.

1905
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:36,820
Always about you.
Only about fucking you.

1906
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,820
Because everything is about...

1907

-You!
-You!

1908
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:39,990
And all you give me

1909
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:41,130
are your
shitty fucking leftovers,

1910
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:42,730
and you keep telling me
it's dinnertime.

1911
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:43,800
That's good.
You read that in one of

1912
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:44,900

1913
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,030
Fuck you, asshole.

1914
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,330

and it's how I feel.
