1
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,302
Welcome.

2
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,352
Our best guess, there's about
250, 275 people in there.

3
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,728
It's hard to count.

4
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,146
We need to be prepared
for, like, 300 people

5
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,106
by the time we get there, right?

6
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,984
Our cargo container,

7
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,112
18-wheeler, that thing
only holds 160 people.

8
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,656
I'm talking 'bout crammed
in there tight...

9
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,241
That's cheek to jowl.

10
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,784
...smashed face to face.

11
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,620
Women and children first.

12
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,996
Listen,
whoever's not on with us,

13
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,581
- they just run, on foot.
- Just go.

14
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,834
That's it.
If they're not with us, they run.

15
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,002
Via de la Amistad,
that's our exit route.

16
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,298
Runs east-west.
It's about one mile from 905.

17
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,509
- Right.
- What you draggin' in that wagon?

18
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,844
Listen, I got HMEs.

19
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,222
I got mortars, I got tear gas,
I got whatever you guys need,

20
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,182
but I'm a little unclear
as to what the plan is.

21
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,435
- I'm gonna need some direction.
- Don't be unclear.

22
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,104
- I got a plan for us.
- Well, what is it?

23
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,438
I mean, you want me
to create a diversion?

24
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,606
You want me to blow something up?

25
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,692
What do you want?

26
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,152
I want you to create a show, Pat.

27
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,199
Okay? This is the announcement
of the motherfuckin' revolution.

28
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,701
- Yeah.
- Make it good. Make it bright.

29
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,870
Impress me.

30
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,954
Team Two's entrance.
We got that?

31
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,247
Yep.
That runs north and south.

32
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,415
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

33
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,001
- Give Pat a walkie.
- Gimme a walkie.

34
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,586
Big truck
coming up Enrico Fermi...

35
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,878
- Channel five.
- Copy that.

36
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,796
Yeah! It's game time.
No more talking 'bout this.

37
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,965
- Let's go!
- All right, let's go,

38
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,216
- let's go, let's go.
- Let's fuckin' go.

39
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,349
Watch, watch, watch.

40
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,405
Get on your knees,
like you 'bout to suck a dick.

41
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,626
Gate guard secure.

42
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,518
Hey, you.
Get up. Hands up. Get up.

43
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,399
- Down. Hey you, get up.
- Get your hands up.

44
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,234
- Wake up. All the way up!
- Down on the ground.

45
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,319
Hands up. Don't look at me.

46
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,486
- All the way up.
- Wake up.

47
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,024
Wake up, soldier boy.

48
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,569
You died and went
to pussy heaven, motherfucker.

49
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,031
Put your arms to the side
so I can see you.

50
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,331
What's your name, dickhead?

51
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,963
I'm Captain Steven J. Lockjaw.

52
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,757
My name is Perfidia Beverly Hills,

53
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,468
and this is a declaration of war.

54
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,680
We're here to right your wrongs,
motherfucker.

55
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,389
You got an army growin'
in your fuckin' guts,

56
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,891
and you put it there.

57
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,976
You didn't count on me.

58
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,062
- Oh, my God.
- You didn't count on my fight.

59
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,564
The message is clear.

60
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,483
Free borders, free bodies, free choices,

61
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,067
and free from fuckin' fear!

62
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,738
Sweet thing.

63
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,615
Is this funny?

64
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,826
Mm.

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,247
Get up.

66
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,543
Not on your feet.

67
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,838
Oh, not on your fuckin' feet.

68
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,218
Since we playin'...

69
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,512
get it up.

70
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,185
Up.

71
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,896
Yeah.

72
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,523
Get it up.

73
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,817
Guys, hurry up!

74
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,238
Be careful! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

75
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,783
<i>Apurarse.</i> Hurry, hurry, hurry!
But be careful!

76
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,869
Be careful!
All the way to the back.

77
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,829
Holy shit.

78
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,750
Keep it moving now.

79
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,586
Up.

80
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,172
Good boy.

81
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,007
Mm.

82
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,511
You like lockin' people up, huh?

83
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,680
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah.

84
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,809
Get on your fuckin' knees!

85
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,435
Now.

86
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,978
Let's go, let's go.

87
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,981
Put it on.

88
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,778
Let's go!

89
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,576
Now get the fuck up.

90
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,874
Let's go. Hands up.
Keep that dick up.

91
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,209
Keep it up.

92
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,336
The fuck out.

93
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,343
Pat.

94
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,427
<i>Go for Pat.</i>

95
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,680
<i>Snap, crackle, pop, baby.</i>

96
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,805
Copy that.

97
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,606
Come on, come on!

98
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,862
I declare war, motherfucker.

99
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,172
I'll be seeing you very soon.

100
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,716
Not if I see you first, fuck face.

101
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,016
We are a political organization

102
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,435
that is free from the eyes,

103
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,521
the ears, and most importantly,

104
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,274
the weapons of the imperialist state,

105
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,192
and this fascist regime!

106
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,238
You are a political prisoner
of the French 75, motherfuckers!

107
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,326
You've been captured by the French 75!

108
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,786
Fuck the police!

109
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,122
<i>- ¡Viva la revolución!</i>
- Let's go!

110
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,004
Motherfuckers, <i>órale!</i>

111
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,341
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

112
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,550
- Hold on, y'all, hold on.
- Shit. Oh, shit.

113
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,052
Where you get
all this energy from?

114
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,511
What are you talkin' about?

115
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,139
I'm getting Ghetto Pat tonight.
I think I like you.

116
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,682
- You like Black girls?
- Mm-hmm.

117
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,850
- Yeah?
- Do I like what?

118
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,644
You like...

119
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,394
Y'all think he like Black girls?
Y'all think he like me?

120
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,230
- I think he does.
- 'Course I fuckin' like Black girls!

121
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,731
So shoot this shit up! Let's go!

122
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,359
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing here?

123
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,068
- Let's go!
- Fuck your mother!

124
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,695
You know
I like fuckin' Black girls!

125
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,904
You know I like Black girls.

126
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,657
And I love you. You love me?
Tell me you love me.

127
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,200
- Tell me you fuckin' love me.
- I love you.

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,121
Calm down. Calm the fuck down.

129
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,585
What I'm doing here

130
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,379
is I'm creating a closed circuit

131
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,342
to remove any static electricity.

132
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,682
And that right there...

133
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,269
That's a shunt. You see that?

134
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,352
Yeah.

135
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,813
This is your blasting cap.

136
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,898
Mm.

137
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,857
Right here.

138
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,533
Very important to keep
your cap shunted like this

139
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,493
when you enter the courthouse.
You got that?

140
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,288
Here's your main charge.

141
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,415
This is your cell phone.

142
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,751
Don't stop.
I see the cell phone.

143
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,213
First thing you're gonna do
is you're gonna turn on your cell phone

144
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,924
without your...

145
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,302
without your cap attached...

146
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,596
so you don't accidentally
detonate your charge.

147
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,182
You're gonna wanna...

148
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,519
You're gonna wanna
put your hands here, right?

149
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,897
- Mmm.
- And then you wanna

150
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,816
take your hands and the cap

151
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,278
and throw it in the circle.

152
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,322
<i>Senator Wilson,
this is a warning for you.</i>

153
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,325
We planted a bomb
at the Haymarket office

154
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,451
of your re-election campaign.

155
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,288
We warned you, that abortion ban,
and you didn't wanna fuckin' listen.

156
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,750
So, for my sisters in need,
we will strike.

157
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,337
Sincerely yours,
Perfidia Beverly Hills, motherfucker.

158
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,219
<i>Revolutionary violence is the only way.</i>

159
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,971
No more tellin' me to vote.

160
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,139
No more tellin' me to overcome.

161
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,390
"Nobody move, nobody get hurt" shit,
it doesn't matter.

162
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,642
Everybody pays.

163
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,687
Don't even bother
lookin' for the French 75.

164
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,190
We'll find you.

165
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,160
- Okay, baby, you ready?
- Yeah.

166
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,380
All right. All right, all right.
Let's go.

167
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,384
- Babe...
- Yeah?

168
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,469
Let's fuck while the bomb go off.

169
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,886
- No, babe.
- Come on, baby.

170
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,389
- Let's fuck, baby.
- Come on, baby, we gotta go.

171
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,807
- Hurry.
- Come on. Come on, baby.

172
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,850
- Let's fuck, baby.
- No, baby. We gotta go.

173
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,686
- Come on, come on. Baby.
- Come on. Come on.

174
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,562
- Come on, baby.
- We gotta go. Come on, baby.

175
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,357
- Come on, baby. Hold on. Wait.
- Bomb goes off in two minutes.

176
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,879
Bring 'em all!

177
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,134
Come on!

178
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,393
Don't say a fuckin' word, okay?
You understand me?

179
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,688
- Get the rest!
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,898
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

181
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,817
Come on, come on!

182
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,950
Stay right there.
Don't you fuckin' move.

183
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,033
Grab him! Let's go.

184
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,952
Stay right fucking there, okay?

185
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,745
You fucking move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

186
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,846
Regular-working White girl.

187
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,889
Now do your thing.

188
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,284
<i>We have two devices
for two locations,</i>

189
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,328
<i>set three blocks apart.</i>

190
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,456
<i>Mae West completes her device
in the administration building,</i>

191
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,625
<i>Perfidia and I take the courthouse.</i>

192
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,336
<i>Bombs are planted,</i>

193
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,256
<i>devices are detonated by remote
at 7 p.m. after hours.</i>

194
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:23,052
<i>From here on in,
it's one battle after another.</i>

195
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,783
What do you want me to do?

196
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,618
I want you to do your worst.

197
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,080
You can blow up anything you want,

198
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,039
it doesn't make any difference to me.

199
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,668
I want my hat.

200
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,004
And my gun.

201
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,592
If you wanna keep doing
what you're doing,

202
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,721
you'll meet me
at the Primrose Path, 2300.

203
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,875
- Can we go slowly?
- Shh.

204
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,085
Wanna take my shoes off.

205
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:04,880
- Shut... up.
- Uh-huh.

206
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,807
Shh.

207
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,142
You're gonna let me go, right?

208
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,936
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yeah.

209
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,881
Holy shit!

210
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,801
Bitch, I felt like Tony Montana!

211
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,344
Yeah!

212
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,511
Fuck!

213
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,722
- Yes!
- It's cathartic.

214
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,557
This pussy right here...

215
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,350
- That one?
- What's it for?

216
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,894
- Um... Fun!
- War! Bitch.

217
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,147
- Nah.
- Oh.

218
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,190
The pussy ain't for fun.
This is the fun.

219
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,025
The guns is the fuckin' fun.

220
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,403
Pussy is the fucking weapon.

221
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,653
I mean...

222
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,990
I see it.

223
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,202
A White-bred, philistine,
asshole corporate culture,

224
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:21,665
whose only end is to perfect
the science of advertising.

225
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,750
But I ain't gonna hold ya, bitch.

226
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,210
If he treats me different after I drop

227
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,296
this motherfucker thing
inside my stomach, bitch,

228
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,672
we gonna have a fuckin' problem.

229
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,465
- Kill him, too.
- Bae, stop.

230
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,925
I'll kill him dead!

231
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,677
Before he beats me!

232
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,347
What the fuck? That...

233
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,349
It's like she doesn't even
realize she's pregnant.

234
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,685
Some other
white chocolate daddy over there

235
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,895
and all this shit.

236
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,772
- You right.
- You feel me? No...

237
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,193
Okay, so put one up and down.

238
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,362
- Okay.
- Okay, so that means...

239
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,657
- I'm the house.
- Okay, yeah.

240
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,079
<i>You know, you are
so unsuitable for my daughter.</i>

241
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,957
Me?

242
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,125
Yeah, you.

243
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,669
And that's hilarious.

244
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,380
I don't...

245
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,509
My child comes
from a whole line of revolutionaries.

246
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,303
And you look so lost.

247
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:20,141
She's a runner, and you a stump.

248
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,936
What are you gonna do
about this baby? Hm?

249
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:39,285
<i>No, I just,
I wanna feel seen and loved and...</i>

250
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,538
<i>I fuckin' carried her nine months.</i>

251
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,958
<i>And now he can just,
gets to fuckin' walk around...</i>

252
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,210
<i>and just swoonin' all fuckin' day.</i>

253
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,672
<i>It's like she's his only girl.</i>

254
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,259
<i>Like, I just no longer exist.
I'm just a fuckin' piece of meat.</i>

255
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,929
<i>And sometimes, I feel crazy,
'cause I'm just like...</i>

256
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,391
<i>am I weird for being jealous of my baby?</i>

257
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,103
I don't fuckin' feel seen.
I don't feel love.

258
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,605
I feel fuckin' ugly. My nipples hurt.

259
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,941
I can barely fucking produce milk.

260
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm not okay.

261
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,417
Baby, where do you think
you're goin', huh?

262
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,712
- Where you goin' like that?
- Stop talkin' to me.

263
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,256
I go as I please.

264
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,342
You realize that
we're a family now, right?

265
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,176
You don't have to do this anymore.

266
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,222
You realize I put myself first, right?
And that's what you scared of.

267
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,101
We have her now.

268
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,935
You do get that, right?

269
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,147
I put myself first,
and I reject your lack of originality.

270
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,109
God, my lack of originality.
Will you stop with all this bullshit?

271
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,403
Would you stop it?
We're a goddamn family.

272
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,823
You have her to take care of.

273
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,825
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

274
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,586
It's okay, baby.

275
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,465
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

276
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,884
It's okay.

277
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,221
This is a new consciousness.

278
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,349
- New consciousness?
- Yeah.

279
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,019
I'm not your udder buddy.

280
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,105
I'm not your mother.

281
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,275
You want your power over me,

282
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,568
the same reason you want
your power over the world.

283
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,990
You and your crumblin' male ego

284
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,409
will never do this revolution like me.

285
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,077
Fuck outta here.

286
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,829
Do the revolution, baby.
Go do it.

287
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,686
You got a baby?

288
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,315
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,900
Male? Female?

290
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,986
She's a girl.

291
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,779
What's her name?

292
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:22,781
Charlene.

293
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,491
Charlene.

294
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,662
Sounds like a Black girl's name.

295
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,290
You like Black girls?

296
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,626
I love 'em.

297
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,005
I love them!

298
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,527
- Get on your knees.
- Get on your fuckin' knees.

299
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,112
- Don't move.
- Now!

300
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,029
Good job.

301
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,905
Get your noses in the carpet.

302
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,992
My name is Junglepussy.

303
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,453
This is what power looks like.

304
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,788
- Put it in.
- See my face?

305
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,039
Put it there.

306
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,416
- This some <i>Set It Off</i> shit.
- Hands up. Put your hands up.

307
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,461
- I don't want you.
- Put your hands up.

308
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,378
I just want your money.

309
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,424
Your money pays
for my artillery, my supplies,

310
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,554
my transportation,
my dynamite, my message.

311
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,473
I am what Black Power looks like.

312
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,433
See my face?

313
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,019
See my face!

314
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,271
I'm the French 75!

315
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,028
Stop moving.

316
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,200
Stop fucking moving.

317
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,703
Stop fuckin' moving, man.

318
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,930
All right, go.

319
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,041
Cuff the left arm, please.

320
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,775
This department
doesn't do any special favors,

321
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,567
especially for Black girls.

322
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,570
You're a killer,
and that's the least of it.

323
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,990
You'll do 30, 40 years in prison.

324
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,621
It's too bad you don't know
anybody with sway.

325
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,215
You can save me.

326
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,403
Because you're in love with me.

327
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:14,865
Yes.

328
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,244
And you can't live without me.

329
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,414
Can you hold me?

330
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,669
I can give you the embrace

331
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,381
of the federal government.

332
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,759
You've gotta tell me
where they are, and name names.

333
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,596
Don't do this.

334
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,476
You have to name names,
or you're gonna go to prison.

335
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,021
Miss Minnie,

336
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,815
do you have a car seat or a carrier?

337
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,107
No, no, no, baby.

338
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,444
These are two scanners that I've made.

339
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,113
This one plays Melody A.

340
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,948
- This one plays Melody B.
- Uh-huh.

341
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,826
Together, they go off
within 200 or 300 yards of each other,

342
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,911
they sync up,
they'll play a main melody.

343
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,579
- Main melody.
- Okay? Somebody else has one of these,

344
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,707
you both know the tune,
you'll be able to find each other.

345
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,709
- This is a trust device.
- Right.

346
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,586
Okay? Rule of thumb
with these scanners,

347
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,880
find somebody else out there
and they happen to have one of these,

348
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,506
trust them with your life, okay?

349
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,383
I'm not passing these out
to just anybody.

350
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,968
- She might be hungry.
- I need some towels.

351
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,720
Miss Minnie,
can you get me some towels?

352
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:18,846
Yeah. All right.

353
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,182
Okay. What's wrong?

354
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,932
I know. We're going.

355
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,769
- Get a phone or don't...
- If you gotta get a cell, make it 1G.

356
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:25,853
The early analogue stuff,

357
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,480
they don't scan
those frequencies anymore.

358
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,147
You'll be fine.
Otherwise, no phones.

359
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,231
- Okay.
- If the towers are up,

360
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,317
we're gonna be able to find
each other in any case.

361
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,528
- All right.
- Memorize everything in this envelope.

362
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,863
Burn it when you're done.

363
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,156
You don't go to Baktan Cross right away.

364
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,910
You go to Denver first.
You spend a week in Denver.

365
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,163
While you're in Denver,
plant those decoys.

366
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,414
When that's all clear
and that job is done,

367
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,250
then you go on to Baktan Cross.

368
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,169
These are the new names and socials.

369
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,171
Right, so who are
we supposed to be here?

370
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,923
You are Bob and Willa Ferguson.

371
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,634
It's a mother and son who died
in childbirth last month.

372
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,969
So we're pretending to be dead folks?

373
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,554
If you wanna think about it
that way, yes,

374
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,015
but there are bigger deaths
down the line if we don't do this.

375
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,808
I want you to think
big picture here, all right?

376
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,309
- Right. Right.
- This is bigger than you or I.

377
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,269
This is bigger than the original
Bob and Willa Ferguson, okay?

378
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,646
Guys, you better hurry up.

379
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,815
Yeah.

380
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,441
Welcome to the world, Bob.

381
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,109
Let's go! Big picture.

382
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,611
Got it. Yeah.

383
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,529
Okay.

384
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,657
Okay. Okay.

385
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,078
You're safe.

386
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,415
- I gotta go. I'm sorry, okay?
- Okay.

387
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,125
- I know you do, but...
- I'm sorry.

388
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,211
I know, but you not sure
you wanna let her stay with us?

389
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,711
- I gotta go, I gotta go!
- I know, I know.

390
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,964
But travel in grace.
Oh, my God.

391
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,592
Here. Hold her.

392
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,719
- All right, I got her, I got her.
- Thanks.

393
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,724
- Come on, baby girl, come on.
- Watch her head.

394
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:49,854
All right.

395
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,648
- Love you.
- I love you.

396
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,407
- Take care.
- Stay safe.

397
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,534
Okay.

398
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,874
<i>Home sweet home.</i>

399
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,040
<i>We've been through all this before,</i>

400
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,750
<i>but I've gotta go through it
one more time.</i>

401
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,255
<i>No contact ever with anyone
from Josie and the Pussycats</i>

402
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,382
<i>or any of your former associates.</i>

403
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,842
<i>No family. No friends.</i>

404
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:21,969
<i>Don't commit any crimes.</i>

405
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,512
<i>You will testify
when we need you to testify.</i>

406
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,099
<i>Look, first order of business,
find a job.</i>

407
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,602
<i>Pay your bills.</i>

408
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,313
<i>- You good?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

409
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,022
<i>Welcome to mainstream America.</i>

410
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,736
<i>Every revolution
begins fightin' demons</i>

411
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,448
<i>but motherfuckers just end up
fightin' themselves.</i>

412
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,700
Hands up!
Put your hands up over your head!

413
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:27,701
She's in the back!

414
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,662
Get your hands up!
Higher!

415
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,813
<i>For valor in the line of duty</i>

416
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,356
<i>and bringing justice

417
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,776

418
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:06,030
<i>we are here to award Steven J. Lockjaw</i>

419

420
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,340
<i>Sixteen years later,</i>

421
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,343
<i>the world had changed very little.</i>

422
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,073
You're not breathing.

423
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,991
Let's do it again.

424
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,402
- History class?
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,326
Teachin' the right kind
of history, I hope.

426
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,123
Lincoln.

427
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,208
Mm-hmm.

428
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,501
I see you got
all the greats here, huh?

429
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,710
Oh, yeah.

430
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,420
What were his intentions?

431
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,757
Got Teddy Roosevelt over there.
You got...

432
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,760
Hope you teach about
the Philippines and all that.

433
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,762
We don't get all
into the details just yet,

434
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,181
- but we don't hide from them, either.
- You should.

435
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,016
You should.
Gotta tell the truth.

436
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,646
And then you got
the Grand Wizard over there, right?

437
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,648
- Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
- Mm.

438
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,317
Forefather.

439
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,068
- Hm?
- Mm.

440
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,237
Fuckin' slave owner.

441
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,114
You... I'm afraid you can't do that
here in the classroom.

442
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,659
- Fuckin' slave owners everywhere.
- Thanks.

443
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,538
Um...

444
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:09,458
Well, overall, to get into it,

445
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,420
Willa's doing really great.

446
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,505
Mm.

447
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,882
She's a confident leader.

448
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,050
- Mm-hmm.
- She works hard.

449
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:22,347
You can tell that she actually cares
about being a good student, you know?

450
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:26,226
She enters class each day
ready to work, full of energy.

451
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,563
The other students
really admire her, um...

452
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,023
Are you okay?

453
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,987
If I get emotional, it's just um...

454
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:41,282
- tears of joy, that's all.
- Oh.

455
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,036
I see this is very emotional for you.

456
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,746
I don't know...

457
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,375
You know, Willa grew up without her mom.

458
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,295
Her mom died
when she was very young.

459
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,130
Oh. I see.

460
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,300
Hm.

461
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,635
So Willa never knew her mother?

462
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,846
No. She never did.

463
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,681
That can be very hard
on a young woman.

464
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,963
Sir, I have Lieutenant Skinner here
to speak with you.

465
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,474
What do you got, Skinner?

466
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:51,353
Sir, Deputy Director of Progress
has orders to speak to you, sir.

467
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,523
Your transportation is set
for 1800 hours, sir.

468
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,567
You know what this is about, Skinner?

469
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,485
- No, sir, I'm...
- Well, I think I do.

470
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,532
That'll be all, Lieutenant.

471
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,632
Welcome, Colonel.
Please follow me.

472
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,387
Have somebody tell my wife
I'll be down in a few minutes.

473
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,222
Colonel Lockjaw,
thanks for coming.

474
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,514
Sandy, great to see you.

475
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,224
Let me introduce you
to Virgil Throckmorton.

476
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,393
- Virgil, Colonel Steve Lockjaw.
- Steve Lockjaw.

477
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,103
- How do you do, Colonel?
- My pleasure, sir.

478
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,731
Yeah, I'm sorry about all the espionage
at the back entrance.

479
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,900
My daughter's getting married
and dress was formal.

480
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,402
So, we didn't want you
to feel out of place.

481
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,652
Perfectly understandable, sir.

482
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:24,737
Please, sit.

483
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,282
Shane Mitchell sends a hello.

484
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:30,827
The big dog.
He still building out that garage?

485
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,788
The construction project
that never ends.

486
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,956
I'm sure he'll get it done.
Will you give him my best?

487
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,123
- Will do.
- Thank you.

488
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,626
How was your journey
from Rio Duarte?

489
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,710
Fine, sir.

490
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,835
You're doing great work down there.

491
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,003
Thank you very much, sir.

492
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,922
Each and every day
is hand-to-hand combat

493
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,007
in the spread
of uncontrolled migration, isn't it?

494
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,344
- Yes, it is, sir.
- Yeah.

495
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,972
Well, "You wanna save the planet,
you start with immigration."

496
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,474
That's exactly right, sir.

497
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,726
You said that.

498
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,936
A few years back,
after Squatting Pebble.

499
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,105
Ah.

500
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,945
I understand you've expressed
an interest in us.

501
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,489
Yes, sir, I have.

502
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,992
And does it honor you to be considered
for membership in our club?

503
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,538
It's a very deep honor, sir.
Yes, it is.

504
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,375
Steve, we have, in the past,

505
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,836
offered membership
to certain members of the military.

506
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,340
We found their tactical
battlefield expertise

507
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,550
to be quite useful.

508
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,719
Now, our aim and your aim is the same.

509
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,347
To find dangerous lunatics,

510
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,809
haters, and punk trash
and stop them.

511
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,313
No more lunatics.

512
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,356
Mm.

513
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,483
Now, I'm not sure
if you've heard or not,

514
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,777
but Jim Kringle passed away.

515
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,112
Oh, I did hear that, yes.

516
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,074
This means an opening.

517
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,367
- Mm.
- Colonel,

518
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,454
I don't think I'm being immodest
when I say

519
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,039
that joining
the Christmas Adventurers Club

520
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,293
means that you are a superior man.

521
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,297
No, not the best man,
not the most intelligent,

522
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,092
the most sophisticated,
or the wisest.

523
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,512
It just means that you are superior
to other human beings,

524
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,306
and you shall never want for riches

525
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,099
or the greatest of friends.

526
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:22,146
Now, we report to ourselves
with a freedom to be creative

527
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,858
and cut through layers of bureaucracy.

528
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,818
We live by the Golden Rule,

529
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,905
in a network
of like-minded men and women

530
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,449
dedicated to makin' the world
safe and pure.

531
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,579
What would you say
to someone who believes

532
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,458
that you have been soft
in your duty to racial purification?

533
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:46,713
I would say they are a liar
who has no business in society.

534
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,548
Or on the planet, for that matter. Mm.

535
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,637
- Do you presently live with a spouse?
- No, sir.

536
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,556
Have you ever consulted
with a mental health professional?

537
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,641
No, sir.

538
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,936
Have you ever had any bills or debts
turned over to a collection agency?

539
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,771
Mm. Well, I did purchase a jet ski.

540
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,983
It was an evolution
of the old Hummingbird Whisperdoo 238.

541
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,362
Called the Dynamite Dolphin 335.

542
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,528
It was defective.

543
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,782
I abstained from payment.
I'd do it again. I have no regrets.

544
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:16,867
Okay.

545
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,454
Have you ever knowingly engaged

546
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,791
in any acts of terrorism
against this country?

547
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,291
No, sir.

548
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,755
Have you ever engaged
in an interracial relationship?

549
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,422
No, sir.

550
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,760
And you are
American-born by gentile?

551
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,844
Yes, sir.

552
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,639
Mm-hmm.

553
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,268
Now, to avoid any misunderstanding,

554
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:45,146
we require absolute secrecy
through the initiation process

555
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,815
to judge how serious
and unselfish you are.

556
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,400
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,195
And to be considered to a vote,

558
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,907
you must submit
to a voluntary vulnerability study.

559
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,661
This identifies anything problematic
in your character.

560
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,704
What could be a problem?

561
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:05,166
I don't know.
What could be a problem?

562
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,210
Absolutely nothing.

563
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,003
We wanna know
who we're standing with.

564
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,338
Sure.

565
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:14,967
Now, it's a Double Yankee
White Inquisitions <i>Completum.</i>

566
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,469
So if you have any doubt
as to your ability

567
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,887
to qualify in body or character

568
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:21,266
as a member
of the Christmas Adventurers Club,

569
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,184
now you have an opportunity to say so.

570
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,690
- Do you wish to withdraw?
- No, sir.

571
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,860
Do you submit yourself?

572
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,739
Yes, sir. I submit myself.

573
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,949
Very well, then.

574
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,786
Now Sandy and I have
to get down to cut the cake.

575
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,871
Oh.

576
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,123
Congratulations
on your daughter's wedding.

577
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,460
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

578
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,878
Thank you.

579
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,172
- Steve.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you, Sandy.

580

I need to know
where The Rocket Man lives.

639
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,791
I need to know his name.

640
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,128
- Okay.
- Ghetto Pat.

641
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,130
Okay. I can cooperate.

642
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,509
Their names are Fred Flintstone
and Arthur Fonzarelli

643
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,719
and their address is Alpha Centauri.

644
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,056
I love it. I love it.

645
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,976
Motherfucker's sittin' on plastic
in a container, he's still got jokes.

646
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,061
I just want you
to know that I'm not scared.

647
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:19,896
I appreciate that.

648
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,190
If I was in your shoes,
I wouldn't be scared, either.

649
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,902
I just don't know if your sister
would feel that way.

650
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,362
What's his sister's name?

651
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,447
Pamela.

652
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:35,829
Oh, no more jokes?

653
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,210
What are their names
and where do they live?

654
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,387
Their names are Bob and Willa Ferguson.

655
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:52,889
They're up in Baktan Cross.

656
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,934
Baktan Cross.

657
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,480
Make me a reason
to deploy in that town.

658
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,106
- Drugs and tacos.
- Got it.

659
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,692
And get all the intel
on the gathering spots,

660
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,568
the hotspots for teenyboppers.

661
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,862
On it.

662
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,039
Shep.

663
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,833
Shep. Hey, come here, come here.

664
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,751
Where'd you...

665
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,672
Come, come with me. How ya doin'?

666
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,717
Get it!

667
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,096
Shep!

668
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,393
Shep.

669
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:41,938
Shep.

670
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,023
Gentlemen, this is Operation Boot Heel.

671
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,858
Our AO is Baktan Cross.

672
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:49,277
This is a sanctuary city
full of thousands of wet 'n stinkies.

673
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:52,489
We have a TST operation
to capture two HVIs.

674
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,157
Adult male, Bob Ferguson.

675
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:57,286
Female juvenile, Willa Ferguson,
age 16, the daughter.

676
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,831
We bag-and-tag the male.
We apprehend the female.

677
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,277

<i>Rimhorn's Chicken Lickin'
Frozen Food Farm.</i>

686
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:08,231
HUMINT reporting has led us to believe
Chicken Lickin' is a front

687
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,318
for a large-scale heroin distribution
operation within the AO.

688
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:14,197
BTR, your main effort,

689
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,532
you are tasked
with the clearing and securing

690
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,867
of Chicken Lickin' Frozen Food Farm
in order to destroy

691
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,994
heroin distribution operations
within the AO.

692
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,748
Simultaneously,
local law enforcement,

693
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,918
<i>you will clear

700
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,744
Thank you.

701
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,373
You're hungover,
and you got home at 3:00 in the morning.

702
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,123
Where were you?

703
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,835
Where, what?
This isn't even warm, sweetie.

704
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,336
Where were you?

705
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,505
Where was I? I was...

706
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,425
Well, I specifically told you
where I was.

707
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,260
You asked me that.
I told you where I was.

708
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:21,012
I was at the Rustic Inn
with the old band.

709
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,891
You remember our old band, right?

710
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:26,893
The old band, sweetie.

711
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:29,063
A Block Past Normal.
You remember Albert?

712
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:29,981
Yeah.

713
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:33,400
Turns out, Albert bought
all this old equipment

714
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,112
from Steely Dan's old studio

715
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,989
to try to get that sort of vintage,
you know,

716
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,367
that sort of crackling tube sound.

717
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,036
You don't need any of
that stuff anymore.

718
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,996
He brought out a computer program.

719
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,123
Boom, with the press of a button...

720
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,164
How'd you get home?

721
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,333
What do you mean?

722
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,878
- How did you get home?
- Well, with my car.

723
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,005
You drove?

724
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,342
So what are you, my babysitter?
What, what, what...

725
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,385
- Yeah.
- I know how to drink and drive, honey.

726
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,846
I know what I'm doin'.

727
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,431
- I didn't have that much.
- Dad.

728
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,557
What? What?

729
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:06,976
What?

730
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,603
I don't wanna be your babysitter.

731
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:09,978
I don't wanna worry
if you wrapped your car

732
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:10,980
around a telephone pole.

733
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,898
- Well, I didn't wrap my...
- I didn't ask for this.

734
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,900
That's just how the cards
were rolled out for me.

735
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,528
- It's "dice," sweetie.
- What?

736
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,032
It's not "cards."
You don't roll cards. It's dice.

737
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,492
Fuck off, Bob.
Just fuck off with that, okay?

738
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:24,452
Grow up.

739
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,786
Wow. Okay.

740
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,748
Well, you... Look.

741
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,291
I like the way
you're standin' up for yourself.

742
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,043
I'm proud of ya, honey,

743
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,503
but the way you, uh,

744
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,838
speak to your father sometimes,
it's just...

745
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,798
I don't know. You're right.

746
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,719
You should tell me
what you think, always.

747
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,179
Never hold anything back from me.

748
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,014
What the fuck is wrong with you?

749
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,766
You're right.
That's somethin' I gotta remember.

750
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,893
And I fuck up sometimes.

751
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,398
Whoa. Who's this? Who's that?

752
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,610
- Who is that?
- They're just my friends.

753
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,739
And they just, they have
a red car like that, just drivin'...

754
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:03,990
Little loud, don't you think?

755
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,034
It's just a car.

756
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,494
And you told 'em
they could do that?

757
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,786
- Yes.
- Told 'em to come to the house?

758
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,704
Yes!

759
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:10,539
Now, who's the one with the lipstick?

760
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:11,958
What's that one's name?

761
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:13,668
- Bobo.
- Bobo.

762
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,628
Now, is that a he
or a she or a they?

763
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,586
Dad, come on.

764
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,380
No, are they transitioning?
I wanna know if...

765
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,465
They're nonbinary.

766
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,007
Okay, I just wanna be polite.
All right.

767
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,885
It's not that hard! "They, them."

768
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,596
And who's this little fuckin' freak
at the door?

769
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,514
Probably Bluto.

770
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,847
They're just comin'
to my house like this, huh?

771
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,182
- Yes!
- All right.

772
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,851
Is that your date to the dance?

773
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,353
- My friend.
- Okay.

774
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,188
You're not goin' anywhere with
your goddamn friend until you take it.

775
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:36,773
Take it!

776
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,199
- Yep. Put it in your pocket.
- I don't wanna put it in my pocket.

777
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,076
Put it in your garter
or whatever you got.

778
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:47,994
My fucking garter?

779
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:49,452
What? Mother...

780
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,204
- What's up, homie?
- Hey, how's it goin'?

781
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,289
- You cool?
- Yeah.

782
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:53,623
- I was just here to pick up Willa.
- Yeah, yeah.

783
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,210
You normally knock that loud
at somebody's house like that?

784
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,878
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah, give us a sec, homie.

785
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,547
Put it in... You got a purse?

786
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,175
This is non-negotiable!
Put it in your purse!

787
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,385
Nobody's coming to get you, Bob.
You know that, right?

788
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:06,637
That's what you think.

789
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:10,682
What's up, guys?
You guys cool?

790
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:12,309
- You guys hangin'?
- Yep.

791
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:13,643
Goin' to the dance?

792
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:14,811
Yeah, it's cool.

793
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,313
Listen,
I'm gonna tell you somethin',

794
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,483
whatever you do to her,
I'm gonna do that exact same thing

795
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,735
to your entire fuckin' family.

796
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,360
- I'm not fuckin' around.
- Wait, what?

797
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,487
- Dad?
- I'm just tellin' ya.

798
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,280
We're talkin' about freedom, baby.

799
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,614
We're talkin' about freedom.

800
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,534
Freedom's a funny thing,
isn't it?

801
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,244
When ya have it, you...
you don't appreciate it,

802
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,996
and when you miss it, it's gone.

803
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,498
- It's just gone. Poof!
- Okay.

804
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,170
There's a quinoa casserole
with Frosted Flakes in the oven.

805
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,005
- Don't leave it on.
- Got it.

806
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,590
- Have fun, homie.
- All right.

807
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,800
All right, cool.

808
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,135
Let go of him.

809
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,347
Yo!

810
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,224
- Yeah?
- Not you, <i>ese.</i>

811
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:55,351
Her, I'm talkin' to her.
Get in the fuckin' car.

812
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,521
Say it.

813
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,856
Say it, baby.

814
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,068
Love you, Bob.

815
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,235
Love you, too.

816
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,157
Fuckin' freaks.

817
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,367
Does anyone have a charger?
My phone's dead.

818
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,536
No. I love your skirt.

819
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,454
- Thank you. I love your dress.
- Thanks.

820
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,164
Your dad's aggro, bro.

821
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:17,916
He's fuckin' paranoid, okay?

822
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,251
Okay.

823
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:36,351
By the tennis court.

824
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,561
- Wait, who got that video?
- And...

825
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,106
No. That's not even the best part.

826
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,775
- And she literally threw up on it.
- Oops. Sorry.

827
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,735
- What?
- Yes!

828
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,902
Wait, do you think
someone out there

829
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,112
has a video of that?

830
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,197
- Wait. I bet they do.
- Wait.

831
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,532
We need to go find Tom and Ron.

832
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,878
Baby, don't be scared.

833
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,048
All right?
Now, I'm gonna say it.

834
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,971
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies
and Hooterville Junction."

835
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,557
Come on, baby,
say it back to me.

836
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,143
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

837
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,103
Hooterville Junction."

838
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:20,728
"Will no longer be
so goddamn relevant."

839
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:21,813
"And women will not care

840
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,108
if Dick finally got down with Jane
on <i>Search for Tomorrow."</i>

841
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,900
"Because Black people
will be in the streets..."

842
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,652
"Looking for a brighter day."

843
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,780
"The revolution
will not be televised."

844
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:33,659
My dad said if anyone said
that shit to me

845
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,244
to trust 'em with my life.

846
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,163
All right, right now, you need to.

847
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:38,914
'Cause you're in trouble, Willa.
All right?

848
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,791
Now, there's an SOS signal out.

849
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,041
I am here to help.

850
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,710
But we have to leave here right away.

851
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,882
Look, I knew your mom
and your dad.

852
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,925
I know you have a lot of questions,
and I'll answer 'em later,

853
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,135
but right now, we have to roll.

854
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,762
- Will you leave here with me?
- Where?

855
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,139
Anywhere but here.

856
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:57,932
'Kay.

857
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:02,146
Okay. You have to stay by my side,
and you have to do exactly as I say.

858
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,688
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

859
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,190
- Do you have a phone on you?
- No.

860
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,568
All right.
Come on, baby, let's go.

861
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,039
Wait, what about my dad?

862
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:22,750
He'll know what to do.
He trained for this.

863
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,253
Oh, God. Come on.

864
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,425
Come on, baby, come on!

865
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,019
Go, go, go, go, go!

866
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,148
One-Three-Echo, One-Three-Delta.

867
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,483
Lights, music.

868
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,155
Have you get all these kids
in the center of the gym.

869
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:54,364
Tell 'em everything's
gonna be okay.

870
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,699
I need to get 'em set down,
and I gotta talk to 'em.

871
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,161
Everybody, listen!
I need you guys to stand up

872
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,913
and join everybody else
on the court.

873
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,719
- Do you know Willa Ferguson?
- No.

874
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:17,846
- Do you know Willa Ferguson?
- No.

875
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,431
- Do you know Willa Ferguson?
- No.

876
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:21,641
Do you know Willa Ferguson?

877
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,438
"Only then can we take on
our real enemy."

878
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,777
"National Liberation Army."

879
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:41,786
Yeah?

880
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:43,289
<i>Bob?</i>

881
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:45,748
Who's this?

882
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:48,585
<i>"We have trouble ahead.
And the road isn't clear."</i>

883
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,797
Wait, excuse me? Who is this?

884
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,135
- Who is this?
<i>- I need the greeting code, Bob.</i>

885
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,512
Oh, fuck.

886
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,016
Well, I don't remember
the fuckin' greeting code

887
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,226
because I got a little bit high.

888
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:08,396
And I... it's been fuckin' years,
so you gotta help me out here with this.

889
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,606
- I don't...
<i>- You're gonna have to think.</i>

890
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:12,693
Right.

891
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,402
Hm. Okay. "The..."

892
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:18,114

"The sunrise.
Sunrise, sunrise in the west."

895
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,418
Right?

896
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:33,547
<i>The campus has been raided
and the Billy Goat has been taken.</i>

897
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,717
Billy Goat is Howard Sommerville,

898
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,802
so Howard Sommerville has been taken.

899
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:42,222
He's been taken or killed.
What's goin' on?

900
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,643
<i>Taken. Yesterday.
And it gets worse.</i>

901

<i>"The Hammer is loose
and en route to Baktan Cross."</i>

Steve Lock...
Steve fucking Lockjaw?

903
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,030
What in the motherfucking fuck?

904
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,530
How could it get
any fuckin' worse than that?

905
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,699
- You're saying Steve Lockjaw...
<i>- It's high alert, Bob.</i>

906
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:04,827
<i>Nothing is secure.
Everything is wrong.</i>

907
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,246
<i>No one is above suspicion.</i>

908
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,664
No, no, no. Slow down. Okay?

909
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:12,460
My daughter...
my fuckin' daughter left the house.

910
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,128
She's not in the house with me,

911
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:15,505
so you gotta give me
more information.

912

<i>Willa's secure.</i>

- Good.

915
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,262
Okay, good. Keep her there.

916
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:25,014
<i>The rendezvous points
are the same as they've ever been.</i>

917

- I'll be seeing...

918
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,061
Well, okay.
Tell me the rendezvous point.

What's the fuckin' rendezvous... Hello?

921
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,570
Fuck! Fuck.

922
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,992
Okay. Okay, Bob.

923
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,413
Don't panic.

924
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,081
Don't fuckin' panic, Bob.

925
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,918
Keep your shit together.

926
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,304
Don't get fuckin' paranoid, man.

927
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,768
Don't get fuckin' paranoid.
Do what you gotta do.

928
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,315
Okay, step one, step one, step one.

929

Open doorway, right.

930

Initial clearance complete.
Conducting back clear.

931
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:15,666
Clear.

Living room.

934
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,340
Get the back.

935
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,483
- I got a tunnel!
- Tunnel!

936
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,094
God damn it.
What do you think?

937
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,931
He's a bomber.

01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:05,313
You just called my house.

955
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:08,233
Let's cut the shit.
I need the rendezvous point.

956
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,775
<i>"What time is it?"</i>

957
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,405
Look, Steve Lockjaw
just attacked my home.

958
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,989
I lost my daughter.

959
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,115
This is Bob Ferguson.

960
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,159
- Do you understand?
<i>- Right. Yes.</i>

961
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:18,744
I don't remember any more of this...

962
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:21,163
I don't remember any more
of this code speak, all right?

963
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,248
Let's just get on with it.
What is the rendezvous point?

964
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:27,085
<i>Okay, I need you to give me the time.</i>

965
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,920
You motherfucker.
You fuckin' with me?

966
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,380
Are you fuckin' with me, motherfucker?

967
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,547
You just called me.

968
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,759
This is Bob Ferguson.
You understand that?

969
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,844
Somebody from the resistance
or the French 75

970
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:37,471
just called my house. Just now!

971
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,599
<i>"What time is it" is a key question
of the underground movement, okay?</i>

972
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,099
<i>Studying the texts is essential.</i>

973
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:45,603
I don't remember any more
of this code speak.

974
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,146
I only remember half of this shit,

975
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,150
and this stupid fuckin' hotline,
which is a fuckin' miracle.

976
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,068
So stop fuckin' with me and give me
the fuckin' rendezvous point.

977
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:56,364
<i>Well, maybe you should have studied
the rebellion text a little harder.</i>

978
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,949
No, no, you called me.
Do you understand that,

979
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:00,159
- you fuckin' retard?
<i>- Sir...</i>

980
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,077
You called me!
I need to find my daughter.

981
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,498
<i>Well, then call us back
when you have the time.</i>

982
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,416
Did you, you just...

983
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,045
Did you just fuckin' hang up on me,
you fuckin' liberal fuckin' prick?

984
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,713
You...

985
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,425
<i>¡Policía! ¡Policía!</i>

986
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:18,677
Okay, let's go!

987
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:24,309
Let's go, let's go,
everybody, let's go!

988
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,858
What are you doin'?
Hands up, on your knees!

989
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:32,818
On your knees!

990
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,488
<i>Get your hands up! Police!</i>

991
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:41,868
<i>Turn around! Turn around!</i>

992
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:53,963
Reina.

993
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:58,051
I'm at work.

994
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:02,889
With what?

995
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,648
Why do you say that?

996
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:20,239
Hang on a sec.
Yeah, can I help you?

997
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,074
Bob.

998
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,327
Bob. Ferguson, yeah.

999
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:28,038
- You okay?
- I need your help, Sensei.

1000
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,498
- Okay.
- I need your help, man.

1001
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:33,502
You still there?
What time do you get off work?

1002
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:36,297
I'm coming.

1003
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:38,591
Call Marisela
and tell her I'm on my way.

1004
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,511
I'm basically in the car.

1005
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,640
Yes.
I'm gonna call Esperanza,

1006
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:48,059
and I'll call you back, okay?

1007
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:49,476
Okay. Bye.

1008
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,686
<i>Bye.</i>

1009
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,354
Bob! We gotta go.

1010
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:55,774
I need a weapon, man!
All you got is goddamn nunchucks here!

1011
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,109
You know where I can get a gun?

1012
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,278
Shit.

1013
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,030
Shit. God damn it. Shit.

1014
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:03,449
- Bob, what's going on?
- It's MKU.

1015
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,118
MKU, man,
they're everywhere right now!

1016
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,869
- They're everywhere.
- MKU? MKU what?

1017
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,454
They busted open my door.

1018
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,414
They're comin' after me
and Willa right now.

1019
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:11,541
Right now.

1020
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,043
- That's heavy metal, bro.
- Yeah.

1021
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,087
Hey. Where is she?

1022
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:18,213
I don't know.
I gotta charge my phone to find out.

1023
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,341
Here, use my phone.

1024
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:20,884
I can't, I can't.
They'll trace that phone.

1025
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,260
I gotta use my phone.

1026
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:24,054
Let's do that at my place, huh?
We gotta go.

1027
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,512
Your place?

1028
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,431
- Yeah.
- You got a gun at your place?

1029
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,390
I'll get you a gun.

1030
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:30,310
- You have a gun, right?
- Okay? Yes.

1031
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:33,813
- Okay.
- Right now, it's a goddamn roundup.

1032
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,981
I gotta deal with this shit.

1033
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,775
Okay. Yeah, let's, let's...

1034
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:40,028
- Let's take that to go. Come on.
- Let's go to your place.

1035
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,154
Let's go to your place.
I'll charge my phone.

1036
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,782
- You got a gun there.
- Bob, Bob, Bob.

1037
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:45,867
- What? What?
- Get off the tatami.

1038
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:47,827
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay. Listen.

1039
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,119
- Breathe.
- All right.

1040
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,038
Okay? Cool out.

1041
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,416
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

1042
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,708
- Ocean waves.
- Let's go.

1043
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,045
Let's go. I'll follow you.
Come on.

1044
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,600
Got a little Latino
Harriet Tubman situation

1045
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:11,810
going on at my place.

1046
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,979
All legit, from the heart.
No cash.

1047
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:15,689
Here, use my phone.

1048
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,899
No, no. No, no, man,
they trace that.

1049
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:19,525
You understand?
They trace those calls.

1050
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,069
- What's with the shades?
- Fuck.

1051
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,365
Look, me and Willa's mom,
we used to run around

1052
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,201
and do some real bad shit together,
all right?

1053
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:30,369
We were part of the French 75.

1054
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,497
They got her,
now they're comin' after us.

1055
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:33,707
Fuck.

1056
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,461
You're a bad <i>hombre</i>, Bob.

1057
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,592
Sit down.

1058
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,431
I'm Agent Danvers.
How are you?

1059
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,393
- Great.
- Great. What's your name?

1060
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,476
Bluto.

1061
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,395
Bluto.
Nice to meet you, Bluto.

1062
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,939
Do ya mind if I have your phone?

1063
01:11:58,023 --> 01:11:58,981
Go ahead and unlock it for me.

1064
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,777
Thank you. Hey, sorry
for crashin' the party like we did

1065
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,529
but we have a few questions
we wanna ask ya.

1066
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,322
- Is that all right with you?
- Sure.

1067
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,990
- You're shakin'. Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1068
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,451
- You nervous?
- Little bit.

1069
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:11,036
- Do you need anything?
- No, we're good.

1070
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,412
If you tell me the truth,
you're outta here in ten seconds.

1071
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,997
- Yes, sir.
- If you lie to me,

1072
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,082
we're gonna have some problems.

1073
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,000
Yes, sir.

1074
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,710
You know Willa Ferguson, right?

1075
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,712
- I do.
- How do you know her?

1076
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:21,755
We're good friends.

1077
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,797
Okay. Do you know
where she is right now?

1078
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,050
I'm not sure.

1079
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:27,469
When's the last time
you saw her?

1080
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,680
Uh, I saw her at the dance.

1081
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,140
Before you guys came in
to the dance.

1082
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:35,935
What's her number?

1083
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:37,186
She doesn't have a phone.

1084
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,355
Her dad doesn't let her, so...

1085
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,109
The only high school girl
in America,

1086
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,194
Willa Ferguson,
doesn't have a phone.

1087
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:47,697
I guess so.

1088
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,586
Alpha Two,
I need a residential address

1089
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:03,378
for a Sergio St. Carlos.

1090
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,761
What is it?

1091
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:11,720
It's an old tracking device.

1092
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:14,181
It goes off
when it's within 100 yards of hers,

1093
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,684
if it works. And it never works.

1094
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,685
Sometimes it does,
but mostly it doesn't.

1095
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,646
What about her phone?

1096
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:22,774
She doesn't have a phone.

1097
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,780
- What, she has a phone?
- Yes.

1098
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,408
She's on... You have
her phone number, man?

1099
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,618
No. Everybody knows
she has a phone, though.

1100
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:35,744
Everybody knows she has a...

1101
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,329
Why didn't she tell me
she has a phone?

1102
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:38,622
Maybe she didn't want you
to get mad.

1103
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,332
She's not allowed
to have a goddamn phone!

1104
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,001
Well, maybe she didn't
want you to get mad.

1105
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:45,296
I don't get mad. I don't get mad
about anything anymore.

1106
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:52,011
Scared?

1107
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,974
- No.
- No?

1108
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,600
Well, you should be.

1109
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,854
Your dad ever mention Steve Lockjaw?

1110
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,359
Yeah.

1111
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,569
Yeah?

1112
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,113
What'd he tell you?

1113
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,615
He's the one who killed my mom.

1114
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,609
Let's fight fire with fire.

1115
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,859
Roger that.

1116
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,529
Net call,
send in Eddie Van Halen.

1117
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,557
Personnel ready!

1118
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:24,354
Gas, gas, gas!

1119
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:35,739
Forward, move!

1120
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,328
Oh, my God.

1121
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,046
BeeGee!

1122
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:54,466
What's the word?

1123
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,844
It's fuckin' World War III
out there, yo!

1124
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:01,140
Meet me at Genesis, right now.

1125
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,356
They're with me. Okay?

1126
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:12,150
Help him bring everything inside,
then meet me upstairs.

1127
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,152
Don't get locked out!

1128
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:18,157
Oh! Everybody.
The store is closed.

1129
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,533
Help! Go help. Come on.

1130
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,034
- You got a charger, homie?
- Let's go, give a hand.

1131
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,662
- Come on. We're closing.
- Thank you. You speak English!

1132
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:23,954
- Thank you, bro.
- Hey.

1133
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,332
We got 20 minutes
to get everybody to the church. Okay?

1134
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,292
Okay.

1135
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:31,253
- I need your help. Okay?
- Okay.

1136
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,422
I need you to go upstairs
and do me a favor.

1137
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,591
I know you don't like the tunnel.
You're gonna have to come with me.

1138
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,385
- Okay. Okay.
- Go upstairs, give 'em a hand. Yeah.

1139
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:39,970
Esteban! Esteban,
get off your phone. <i>Ándale.</i>

1140
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,556
Come to the front of the store
and keep an eye on the store.

1141
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,434
- Esteban, <i>vámonos</i>!
- Hey, get off the phone!

1142
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:47,185
- Get off the phone! Come on!
- I'm not on the phone, man!

1143
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,438
God damn!

1144
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,023
I'm trying to charge the phone!

1145
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,315
- You see that?
- Bring it upstairs.

1146
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:52,984
- Goddamn, man!
- Bring it upstairs.

1147
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:22,805
Guys, clean it up.
Spick-and-span.

1148
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,015
Bob.

1149
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,809
Not safe for you there.
Follow me.

1150
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:31,939
Derrick, line 'em up in the hallway!

1151
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:34,274
I'll be in 24!

1152
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,492
You win some
and you lose some, Bob.

1153
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:44,327
- Yeah.
- Bob, Bob, Bob.

1154
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:45,578
Get back on defense.

1155
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,747
- Back on defense, man, yeah.
- Yeah.

1156
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,248
Thank you, man.
Thank you, thank you.

1157
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,251
Here.

1158
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:54,670
Do it in my room.
It's more privacy.

1159
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,923
Aubrey, get off the phones.
Go to the second floor.

1160
01:17:58,548 --> 01:17:59,841
- We're moving them out.
- Where's your room?

1161
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:00,885
- Okay?
- Back here, man?

1162
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,095
- Hey, Bob, Bob.
- Back here?

1163
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,512
- Yeah?
- This is everybody.

1164
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:05,305
- Yeah. Hi.
- Everybody, this is Bob.

1165

- Hello, Bob.
- The Gringo Zapata<i>.</i>

1166

Everyone, say hello.

1167
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,103
- Okay. Jacob...
- Right on, man.

1168
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,436
I need you to go
to the second floor.

1169
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,939
Marisela, we're moving them out.

1170
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,064
- What?
- Now, now.

1171
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,943
Yeah. Bob, Bob. Bob.
This is Rachel.

1172
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,528
- Hi, Rachel. How are you?
- Rachel, this is Bob

1173
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,822
- and this is Landon, the newest one.
- Hey, Landon.

1174
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:21,905
- How are you?
- Hi.

1175
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:23,615
- Hey, is it back there?
- Okay. Yeah. Back here.

1176
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:25,409
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1177
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:26,911
Right here.
Right behind the couch.

1178
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:28,287
Thank you, brother, thank you.

1179
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,706
Mariah. Madison. Come on.

1180
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:33,167
- Out.
- Got it.

1181
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:34,292
Come on, it's my room.

1182
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:36,337
Thank you, girls.

1183
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:39,297
Yeah. Come on.

1184
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,050
Come on.

1185
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:47,931
Shit.

1186
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:52,895
Sorry, man.

1187
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:54,604
Come on.

1188
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:55,605
It's okay.

1189
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,234
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

1190
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:00,694
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

1191
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:05,992
I got power. I got power.

1192
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,042
Please, please, please.

1193
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,962
<i>"Rise and shine."</i>

1194
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:21,131
Hi. What's up?

1195
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:24,969
What's up, homie?
It's me again. Bob Ferguson.

1196
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:29,181
I don't know if you remember,
but we spoke earlier on the phone.

1197
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:32,185
I think we had
a little misunderstanding.

1198
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,020
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

1199
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:37,564
I was trying to get the rendezvous point
for my daughter. Willa.

1200
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,693
<i>Right. If you can't answer
"What time is it?"</i>

1201
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:43,320
<i>I cannot give you
the rendezvous point.</i>

1202
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,697
<i>This is a key tenet
of the rebellion text.</i>

1203
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:46,990
- "What time is it?"
<i>- I'm surprised you can't name it.</i>

1204
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:48,658
<i>I don't know if you are...</i>

1205
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:49,827
<i>...who you say you are.</i>

1206
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:51,453
Okay.

1207
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:52,829
Well, look, look, maybe I can...

1208
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:54,623
Maybe I can give you
some information

1209
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,626
and then you give me
some information, all right?

1210
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,377
We'll just share
a little bit of information.

1211
01:19:58,461 --> 01:19:59,503
My name is Bob Ferguson.

1212
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:00,962
I don't know if you've ever
heard of me. All right?

1213
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,425
I was a part of French 75 for years.
Years and years, all right?

1214
01:20:04,509 --> 01:20:07,761
They used to call me "Ghetto Pat,"
"Rocket Man," something like that.

1215
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,805
Only problem is, I, uh...

1216
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:13,935
I fried my brain since then, man.

1217
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:16,729
I have abused drugs and alcohol

1218
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,273
for the past 30 years, man.

1219
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,650
I'm a drug and alcohol lover

1220
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:24,904
and I cannot remember
for the life of me,

1221
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,155
or the life of my only child,

1222
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,033
the answer to your question,
"What time is it?"

1223
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:31,827
8:15.

1224
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:34,247
Now, I need
this rendezvous point,

1225
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,664
you understand what I'm sayin'?

1226
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:37,582
- I need it.
<i>- I understand.</i>

1227
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,585
<i>- And the question is...</i>
- Fuck!

1228
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,087
<i>..."What time is it?"</i>

1229
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,713
If you don't give me
the rendezvous point,

1230
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,841
I swear to God,
I will hunt you down

1231
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,927
and stick a loaded
fuckin' hot piece of dynamite

1232
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,512
right up your fuckin' asshole.

1233
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:55,059
<i>Okay, this doesn't feel safe.
You're violating my space right now.</i>

1234
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:57,228
Violating your space?
Man, come on,

1235
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:58,979
what kind of revolutionary
are you, brother?

1236
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:00,146
We're not even
in the same room here.

1237
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,314
We're talkin' on the phone, like men!

1238
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:02,608
Rachel, let's take the boys outside...

1239
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:04,025
<i>- Okay, there's no need to shout.</i>
- ...to the other room.

1240
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,528
<i>This is a violation of my safety.</i>

1241
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,988
<i>These are noise triggers.</i>

1242
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,363
Fuckin' noise triggers.

1243
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,073
Listen, I wanna know somethin'.

1244
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:12,243
I wanna know one thing
when this is all said and done.

1245
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:14,996
What is your name?
I need to know your name.

1246
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:17,247
<i>- My name is Comrade Josh.</i>
- Yeah.

1247
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,207
Comrade Josh.

1248
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,917
Well, get a better name,
Comrade Josh.

1249
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:23,170
That's a fuckin' ridiculous name
for a revolutionary, first off.

1250
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,131
Second off,
I wanna know your coordinates.

1251
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,757
I wanna know your location
right now. What is it?

1252
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:31,220
<i>I'm in a secure location,
somewhere between</i>

1253
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:35,265
<i>the stolen land of the Wabanaki
and the stolen land of the Chumash.</i>

1254
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,435
You're fuckin' intolerable, man.
You are...

1255
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:40,104
You really know...
you're really intolerable, man.

1256
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:42,064
This is not the way
the revolutionaries do shit.

1257
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:43,774
You know how hard
you are to talk to?

1258
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:46,484
Do you know the information
that I'm trying to give you?

1259
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,487
You're a little nitpicking prick!

1260
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,739
That's what you are,
a little nitpicking prick.

1261
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,867
And you know what I'm gonna do
to nitpicking pricks?

1262
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:55,328
<i>- Hm.</i>
- I'm gonna call in a Greyhawk Ten.

1263
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,622
<i>You're calling in a Greyhawk Ten?</i>

1264
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,873
I'm callin' in a Greyhawk Ten.
All right?

1265
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,708
I want you to get your supervisor

1266
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,586
on the phone right now,
'cause I know you got one.

1267
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:06,005
I know you got one,
Comrade Josh. All right?

1268
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:07,922
Yeah, I'm goin' way
over your fuckin' head.

1269
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,176
Way over your head. All right?

1270
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,261
Put your commanding officer
on the phone now.

1271
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:13,887
<i>Because you're calling in
a Greyhawk Ten?</i>

1272
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,057
I'm callin' in a Greyhawk Ten,
Comrade Josh.

1273
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:19,644
<i>Please hold.</i>

1274
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:22,604
Fuckin' prick. I got him.

1275
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,230
I got him right where I want him.

1276
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:27,068
That's some fucked-up,
nitpickin' shit, Bob.

1277
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:29,569
He got you on one password.

1278
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:30,904
Assholes.

1279
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:31,988
I'm sorry about...

1280
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:33,365
I brought all this shit
to your door, man.

1281
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:34,617
I'm sorry about everything.

1282
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:39,788
We've been laid siege
for hundreds of years.

1283
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:40,956
You did nothing wrong.

1284
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,667
Don't get selfish.

1285
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,128
Life, man.

1286
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,547
Life!

1287
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:53,135
Just always some little...
little, tiny detail, right?

1288
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:58,224
Okay.
Get to the front.

1289
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,394
Jacob! We go!

1290
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:04,646
Okay, guys.

1291
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:12,822
Esperanza. <i>Buenas noches.</i>

1292
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,921
Why is this takin'
so long? For God's sakes.

1293
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,257
You guys are so incompetent. For...

1294
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:34,635
Fuck! Hurry up.

1295
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:45,270
Alpha One, this is Zulu.

1296
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,273
I got a squirter internal
to the target building.

1297
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,774
Follow on for Sergio St. Carlos.

1298
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:51,152
I need to go kinetic.

1299
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:54,279
Setting up breach time now.
I need two follow-on vehicles.

1300
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,326
<i>Yep. Who's this?</i>

1301
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:01,703
Yeah! Hi! Who's this?

1302
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,872
<i>- Who's this?</i>
- Who's this?

1303
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,248
<i>- Who's this?</i>
- This is Bob Ferguson.

1304
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:06,332
Who's this?

1305
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:07,542
My brother.

1306
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,420
- <i>Who's this?</i>
- It's your man, Talleyrand.

1307
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,421
<i>Talley!</i>

1308
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,256
Talley, my brother.
My brother, you listen, man.

1309
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,634
You gotta help me out, man.
They got Willa.

1310
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,219
You heard they got Willa, right?
I need...

1311
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,220
I need the rendezvous point, now.

1312
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:21,055
<i>I need you to answer
one question for me, Pat.</i>

1313
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,975
No, no, man. Please don't
make me go through this, man.

1314
01:24:23,057 --> 01:24:24,518
- Pat. Pat. Slow down.
<i>- I don't remember...</i>

1315
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:25,935
- You're gonna know it.
<i>- ...any more of these answers.</i>

1316
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,395
<i>- It's been too many years.</i>
- You're gonna know it.

1317
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,605
<i>Please, please.</i>

1318
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,149
What's my favorite kind of pussy?

1319
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:35,695
Mexican Hairless.

1320
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,490
Okay. One second.

1321
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,827
You motherfucker.
This is a goddamn war hero.

1322
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,997
Hey, rendezvous
is Sisters of the Brave Beaver.

1323
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:48,292
Sisters of the Brave Beaver.
I don't know...

1324
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,835
Is that that compound out in the hills?

1325
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,628
I need the coordinates,
exact coordinates.

1326
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,963
Okay, one second.
Tell him how to get there.

1327
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,548
Apologize. Mean it.

1328
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:57,676
Hello.

1329
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,261
Hi, prick! Give me
the fuckin' coordinates now.

1330
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:01,514
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Make it snappy!

1331
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:05,184
<i>Okay. Sister Rochelle's
is located up Old Mission Road...</i>

1332
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,100
Old Mission.

1333
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,936
- Okay, slow down, articulate.
<i>- ...to Craw Creek Road...</i>

1334
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:15,069
Bring up the hoolie.

1335
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:17,529
Sensei! Sensei!

1336
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,796
<i>In the Chupacabra Hills.</i>

1337
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:35,005
Chupacabra Hills.

1338
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,716
<i>And I just wanna formally say
that I am sorry.</i>

1339
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,385
You wanna formally say
you're sorry, huh?

1340
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:40,426
<i>Yeah.</i>

1341
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:43,221
What was the fuckin' password,
by the way, you fuckin' prick?

1342
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:47,100
"Time doesn't exist,
yet it controls us anyway."

1343
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:50,061
Fuck you, you fuckin' moron!

1344
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:53,606
Fuck you! You obviously
don't have kids, you fuckin' idiot!

1345
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:01,532
Hey! Man, I got the coordinates.

1346
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:04,368
It's Old Mission Road to Craw Creek,

1347
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:05,743
and then to Chupacabra Hills.

1348
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:07,328
- Time to go, Bob.
- Right, let's go.

1349
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,538
Let's go, I got the coordinates, man.

1350
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,082
- Look out the window, Bob.
- What?

1351
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:11,792
Be careful.
Look out the window. Be careful.

1352
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:13,293
Shit. Shit.

1353
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,253
They're here!

1354
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,590
God damn it, they're...
Shit. They're...

1355
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:20,134
O.G., the store is closed.
The <i>inquilinos</i> are gone.

1356
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:21,385
If they knock,
you know what to do.

1357
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:23,804
How'd they find us, man?
How'd they find us?

1358
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,264
I think you were
making too many calls, man.

1359
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,765
I think they traced your call.
They must have traced your calls.

1360
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,643
- What's the plan, man?
- BeeGee!

1361
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,729
- What's the plan?
- I'm thinking.

1362
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:33,229
- Is that my weapon?
- Hang on.

1363
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:34,606
- BeeGee! Okay.
- We gotta go, man.

1364
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,190
You're gonna take him up
on the roof,

1365
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,319
across to my car on Lapham's Alley.
Here are my keys.

1366
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,572
You drop him off, you call me.
Latino Heat, come with me!

1367
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:43,114
No, no, no, man,
I'm not goin' with them.

1368
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:46,368
No, I'm not goin' with them!
I'm supposed to go with you.

1369
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:47,912
I need you, brother.
Please, Sensei.

1370
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:49,037
Sensei, Sensei, please!

1371
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:51,081
Courage, Bob. Courage.

1372
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,167
That's it?

1373
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,462
Courage. Yeah. Yeah.

1374
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,548
Thank you. Hey!
Thank you, Sensei.

1375
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:02,551
Thank you, Sensei! Thank you!

1376
01:27:03,217 --> 01:27:04,261
God damn it!

1377
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:06,012
<i>¡Viva la revolución!</i>

1378
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:11,351
<i>¡Viva!</i>

1379
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:22,738
This way, Bob!

1380
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:26,742
Pass me all your shit, man!

1381
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:27,701
Here.

1382
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,494
<i>I don't give a shit what you do.</i>

1383
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,537
I'm gonna need that number
in the next ten seconds.

1384
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:32,997
I know nothing, sir.

1385
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,042
Do I look like your parent?

1386
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:38,420
- Kinda.
- Give me the fuckin' number

1387
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:40,588
or stand up, put your hands
behind your back.

1388
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:41,756
I don't have her phone number.

1389
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,841
Up. Put your hands
behind your back.

1390
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:46,929
Cuff him. Get him outta here.

1391
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:49,390
I have it.

1392
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,225
You have it now?

1393
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,268
What is it?

1394
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:57,480
I thought you took
AP Common Sense.

1395
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:58,690
Sit the fuck down.

1396
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:01,443
What's the number?

1397
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:03,612
It's under "Hello Kitty."

1398
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,244
Give it to me.

1399
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,872
Give it to me!

1400
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:18,502
I asked you if you had a phone.

1401
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:21,046
You looked me in my face,
and you lied.

1402
01:28:22,296 --> 01:28:25,591
I am here to save your fuckin' life.
Do you understand?

1403
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:28,761
Don't lie to me again.

1404
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:35,728
Alpha Two's on the horn!

1405
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,771
The female's handset's
heading south on 135.

1406
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:48,823
Freeze.

1407
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,828
Cell One, Exfil.

1408
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:56,622
All right.

1409
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,315
Fuck.

1410
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:39,332
<i>¡Ándale, Bob!
¡Vamos, vamos!</i>

<i>- Sensei,</i>

1412
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:26,921
<i>your guy fell off the roof
and got arrested.</i>

1413
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:28,881
What the fuck happened?

1414
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,176
<i>He fell 40 feet
and fuckin' fell in a tree, man.</i>

01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:33,970
Chota <i>got him with a Taser.</i>

1416
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:35,514
And my rifle?

1417
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:36,597
<i>It's with me.</i>

1418
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:37,682
Okay.

1419
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,435
Meet me at Sacred Heart.

1420
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:39,744
Rochelle.

1421
01:31:40,494 --> 01:31:43,582
Well, Deandra,
what new mischief now?

1422
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,708
I have the child Willa Ferguson.

1423
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:48,837
This is
Perfidia Beverly Hills' daughter.

1424
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:52,506
I'm comin' to you in an hour of need
and desperation for safekeeping.

1425
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,434
Unbelievable.

1426
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,020
Do I look just like her?

1427
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:08,356
No. Not really.

1428
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,777
But you do on the inside.

1429
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:15,988
Which makes you
quite a risk around here.

1430
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,496
The daughter of a rat
is a baby rat.

1431
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,916
And we must be careful.

1432
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:30,503
Can you cook?

1433
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,506
Yes.

1434
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:35,967
We will not allow residence to anyone

1435
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:41,305
who cannot take responsibility
for both her input and output.

1436
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:45,185
I can earn what I eat
and secure what I shit,

1437
01:32:45,269 --> 01:32:46,603
if that's what you mean.

1438
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:50,023
That's what I mean.

1439
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:55,737
Sister Vox, show Baby Perfidia
to the Pancho Villa room.

1440
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:58,030
A'ight.

1441
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:00,617
Let me run shit down to you.

1442
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:02,536
So you have the towels over here.

1443
01:33:02,618 --> 01:33:04,496
The bathroom is straight through there.

1444
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:06,747
The pillows is right there,
as you can see.

1445
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:10,502
And don't ask for the fuckin' Wi-Fi,
'cause we ain't got none.

1446
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:12,546
Make yourself at home, Goldilocks.

1447
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,096
<i>What does she know?</i>

1448
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,018
<i>She thinks her mom was a hero.</i>

1449
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:29,020
<i>And I...</i>

1450
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,442
I didn't have the guts
to tell her the truth.

1451
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,404
I couldn't.

1452
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:41,490
Perfidia Beverly Hills

1453
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:46,287
is a problem that keeps on givin'.

1454
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:51,083
<i>This revolution doesn't need
another one of her runnin' around.</i>

1455
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:53,837
<i>Shit's hard enough.</i>

1456
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:02,345
You got more fight in you
than the rest of us, Deandra.

1457
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:07,184
I got sick of this shit
a long time ago.

1458
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:41,134
- Tim!
- Alice, how are you, darlin'?

1459
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:43,220
Very well. Thank you.

1460
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,930
- You look great. You hungry?
- Well, thank you.

1461
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:47,556
Uh, yeah, yeah.

1462
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,060
But I'm actually, I think
I'm about to be runnin' late.

1463
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:53,188
- Better get down there.
- Well, I can fix you some pancakes.

1464
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,773
You could have 'em
on your way out.

1465
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:56,649
Are these the banana pancakes?

1466
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,527
The famous Alice banana pancakes?

1467
01:34:58,609 --> 01:35:00,529
Those are the ones.

1468
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:03,407
- I know they're waiting for you.
- I better get down there.

1469
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,658
It's great to see you again, Alice.

1470
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:07,661
Oh, good to see you, Tim.

1471
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:07,887
Come in.

1472
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:15,479
Tim.

1473
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:17,314
Merry Christmas. Hail Saint Nick.

1474
01:36:17,396 --> 01:36:18,439
Merry Christmas.

1475
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:19,774
- How ya doin'?
- Good, good.

1476
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:20,859
- It's been too long.
- Yeah,

1477
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:21,984
it's good to see you again, Sandy.

1478
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,235
You know Virgil Throckmorton.

1479
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:25,238
Virgil's down
from Cleansing and Distortion.

1480
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:26,864
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1481
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:29,201
And you know
Bill Desmond from Whitehall.

1482
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:30,868
Bill, good to see you again,
and merry Christmas.

1483
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,953
And of course you know Roy More.

1484
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:35,372
Fifth Fleet Field General
from the Southwest.

1485
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:37,042
Absolutely, sir. Good morning.

1486
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:38,918
Take a seat.

1487
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,548
So... what's cookin'?

1488
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:46,801
How can I help?

1489
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:48,386
Well, Tim,

1490
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,180
there's this troubling little rumor
we've just heard.

1491
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,475
And we brought you in

1492
01:36:53,557 --> 01:36:54,935
to see if you can help clear it up.

1493
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:57,979
I'm gonna hand you over to Bill.
He'll give you the details.

1494
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,648
- Over to you, Bill.
- All right.

1495
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:01,899
Tim, I'm gonna get right to it. Um...

1496
01:37:02,943 --> 01:37:05,069
There's an unconfirmed report

1497
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:07,363
that Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw

1498
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:09,949
is the father of a mixed-race child.

1499
01:37:13,662 --> 01:37:15,788
Which mix?

1500
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,833
There's no real easy way
to say this, but...

1501
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:22,837
Yeah.

1502
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:24,881
It's Black.

1503
01:37:31,762 --> 01:37:33,222
Well, uh...

1504
01:37:35,432 --> 01:37:38,520
that would be quite the revelation
if it were true.

1505
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:42,940
Bill, may I ask
what your source is?

1506
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:47,319
Sure. That's part of
a Double Yankee White background check.

1507
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:49,905
Some old paperwork turned up
in a computer file

1508
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:53,493
on the Black militant
named Junglepussy.

1509
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:58,081
She told an officer
this very story 15 years ago.

1510
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,250
Fifteen years ago.

1511
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:03,377
It's been there the whole time,
in ancient file.

1512
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:05,130
Pure luck we caught it.

1513
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,756
So where's the Pussy?

1514
01:38:07,841 --> 01:38:08,966
Oh, she's long dead.

1515
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,552
Oh. No more Pussy.

1516
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,305
Now, a few days ago,

1517
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:15,306
Lockjaw hired a bounty hunter

1518
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,143
to make a civilian extraction
in El Paso.

1519
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:21,395
It was led by an Avanti Q.
You know him?

1520
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,523
Yeah, I know Avanti.
He's a good soldier.

1521
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:24,940
Not great?

1522
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:27,860
I mean, he's excellent,
but he's not a native son.

1523
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,195
That's his dirty little secret.

1524
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:31,823
He passes for half-Mexican,

1525
01:38:31,905 --> 01:38:33,783
but he's actually part Comanche

1526
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:35,493
or, I don't know, Eskimo.

1527
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:37,328
He's a fantastic tracker.

1528
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,206
He'll tell you how much money
someone had in their pocket

1529
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:42,583
based on a footprint,
but he is not homegrown,

1530
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,127
so I would not trust it.

1531
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,587
Yeah, well,

1532
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:49,048
he's apparently good enough
to find what Lockjaw was lookin' for.

1533
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:50,050
Yeah.

1534
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:53,261
He found Howard Sommerville.

1535
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,640
Ex-French 75.
He runs an underground railroad,

1536
01:38:58,224 --> 01:39:00,476
bringing illegals
from our southern border

1537
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,270
to Baktan Cross in the north,

1538
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:04,814
where he set up
a so-called sanctuary city,

1539
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:08,068
giving jobs and housing
to drug dealers and psychopaths.

1540
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:10,779
He's also a reefer addict.

1541
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,948
Really? Well, he sounds like
a class act, this guy.

1542
01:39:14,032 --> 01:39:16,283
Next thing we know,
Colonel Lockjaw's mobilized

1543
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,411
his task force into Baktan Cross

1544
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:23,457
and conducted a Class-A raid
on the Chicken Lickin' Frozen Farm.

1545
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:26,670
Oh, no. I love their nuggets.

1546
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:30,006
Well, this could mean
a nugget shortage.

1547
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:32,634
Not to mention
the Chicken Lickin's owned

1548
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,551
by our fellow Christmas Adventurer,

1549
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:38,055
Brother Burt Rimhorn,
who wants his wetbacks back to work.

1550
01:39:38,972 --> 01:39:39,807
Next...

1551
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,725
He hit the high school, Tim.

1552
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:42,976
Yeah.

1553
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,520
The high school.

1554
01:39:45,896 --> 01:39:49,359
And now, all hell's broken loose
on the streets of Baktan Cross.

1555
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:51,277
And he's turned off his A-TAK's.

1556
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,195
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I think I'm pickin' up

1557
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:54,823
what you gents
are layin' down here.

1558
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:56,658
This is a curious chain of events.

1559
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:00,537
So Lockjaw's lookin'
for his half-breed,

1560
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:03,122
but do we know
where the mama bear is?

1561
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:04,748
Funny you should ask that.

1562
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:09,337
Perfidia Beverly Hills.

1563
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:13,132
Currently M.I.A.
Former French 75.

1564
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,176
She went into witness protection
about 15 years ago,

1565
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:18,762
only to disappear.

1566
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:20,305
The arresting agent...

1567
01:40:21,056 --> 01:40:23,268
Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw.

1568
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:26,979
Agency sightings have her
in Cuba or Algiers,

1569
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:28,439
depending on the report.

1570
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:29,565
So...

1571
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:33,235
not the mothering type,
I take it.

1572
01:40:34,404 --> 01:40:36,948
And they call us the savages.

1573
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:40,993
Lockjaw got his dick dirty.

1574
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:45,164
He needs to clean it.

1575
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,502
If he can find this kid,

1576
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,630
he can dispose of the evidence,

1577
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:56,967
and continue to make fools
out of all of us.

1578
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:03,015
What would you like me to do, sir?

1579
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,939
Tim, given your expertise
in family cases,

1580
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:12,065
- we felt that maybe...
- Make it clean.

1581
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:16,404
Clean?

1582
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,742
We should all be able
to eat off the floor.

1583
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:24,453
Yeah. It's that clean.

1584
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:26,956
Yes, sir.

1585
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:31,252
Well, all right, gents.

1586
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,253
Looks like I'm headed west.

1587
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,298
- And may Saint Nick be with you.
- Ah.

1588
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:38,967
All hail Saint Nick.

1589
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,958
I have something to ask you, okay?

1590
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:13,962
'Kay.

1591
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:18,006
Was she a rat?

1592
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:24,346
Yeah, she was.

1593
01:42:27,432 --> 01:42:29,519
My dad told me she was a hero.

1594
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:32,814
Hey, stop banging your head.

1595
01:42:32,896 --> 01:42:35,233
Stop banging your head.

1596
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:37,609
- Stop banging your head on that.
- Okay.

1597
01:42:37,694 --> 01:42:40,279
- Sir, do you know your last name?
- No.

1598
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:43,240
What's your last name?

1599
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:44,826
Batman.

1600
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:46,618
Okay, come on.
I need to know your real last name.

1601
01:42:47,369 --> 01:42:49,747
Um, Parker. Peter Parker, man.

1602
01:42:49,831 --> 01:42:50,832
- Peter Parker.
- Yeah.

1603
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:52,125
All right, listen.
This is your last chance.

1604
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:53,292
If you don't give me
your real last name,

1605
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:54,460
it's gonna be another charge.
What is it?

1606
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:56,837
Okay, okay. Stop harassing me,
for God sakes!

1607
01:42:57,963 --> 01:42:59,841
Parker. Jim Parker, man.

1608
01:42:59,923 --> 01:43:01,341
- Your name's Jim Parker?
- Yeah.

1609
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:02,969
Okay, Jim.
What's your date of birth?

1610
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:05,179
I'm somewhere in the '80s, man.

1611
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:06,805
- In the '80s.
- Yeah.

1612
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:09,182
Let's go. You're up.

1613
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,810
Let's go.

1614
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:14,980
Get up. Well, fuck.

1615
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:19,569
Sit down there.

1616
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:24,198
Mr. Jim Parker,
is that correct?

1617
01:43:24,282 --> 01:43:25,658
Forty-two years old?

1618
01:43:25,742 --> 01:43:28,536
Sir, she's gonna be taking
your vitals behind you, okay?

1619
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:30,371
Mr. Parker.

1620
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:32,414
Mr. Parker, over here.

1621
01:43:32,497 --> 01:43:34,250
Do you have any medical problems?

1622
01:43:35,752 --> 01:43:36,793
- Yeah.
- Mr. Parker,

1623
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:38,087
can you look at me, sir?

1624
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,173
Bob. Can you look at me?

1625
01:43:42,257 --> 01:43:43,509
Are you diabetic?

1626
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:46,054
Are you diabetic?

1627
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:48,890
Uh-huh.

1628
01:43:48,972 --> 01:43:50,182
Yeah.

1629
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:52,268
Did you take your insulin yesterday?

1630
01:43:56,021 --> 01:43:57,606
You know,
if you're a bad <i>hombre,</i>

1631
01:43:57,689 --> 01:44:00,443
you make sure you take your insulin
on a daily basis. Right?

1632
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:03,947
Officer, we're not gonna
be able to take this one.

1633
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:05,280
He needs to go out to the ER.

1634
01:44:06,823 --> 01:44:08,076
Thank you, sir.
Have a good day.

1635
01:44:09,202 --> 01:44:10,787
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- Good. How are you?

1636
01:44:10,869 --> 01:44:12,037
Good, thanks.

1637
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:17,001
Mr. Parker, here's your restroom, okay?

1638
01:44:17,085 --> 01:44:18,418
Let's check your sugar.

1639
01:44:20,505 --> 01:44:22,756
You are gonna go
through the bathroom,

1640
01:44:23,757 --> 01:44:25,426
straight down the hall
to the right

1641
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:26,844
to the fire escape.

1642
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,011
Right now.

1643
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:30,264
- Right now?
- Right now.

1644
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:36,813
Hey, Officer. You wanna come
sign this intake form with me?

1645
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:52,161
God!

1646
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:58,542
Hey, Bob!

1647
01:44:58,626 --> 01:45:01,003
Sensei, man! Sensei, brother!

1648
01:45:01,087 --> 01:45:03,672
Oh, my God. Sensei, thank you.
Thank you, brother. Thank you!

1649
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:05,632
Hey. Here, have one.

1650
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,760
Thank you! Oh, my God.

1651
01:45:07,844 --> 01:45:09,845
All right. Let's do a selfie.

1652
01:45:09,929 --> 01:45:11,889
Oh, my God, you got...
you got...

1653
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,807
- A what? Okay.
- Here.

1654
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:15,393
We did it. We did it.

1655
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:17,103
- Let's get out of here, man.
- Where we goin'?

1656
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:19,188
Sisters of the Brave Beaver.

1657
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:20,773
Chupacabra Hills.
Chupacabra Hills.

1658
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:21,983
Let's play offense.

1659
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:24,484
Siri, Sisters of the Brave Beaver.

1660
01:45:24,569 --> 01:45:26,069
<i>Getting directions
to the Sisters...</i>

1661
01:45:26,154 --> 01:45:27,154
Chupacabra Hills.

1662
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:28,780
<i>- Chupacabra Hills.</i>
- Chupacabra Hills.

1663
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:31,743
Okay. Not every day
you get to rescue a 75er

1664
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:33,118
twice in the same day!

1665
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:34,787
Let's rock and fuckin' roll!

1666
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:36,122
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

1667
01:45:48,384 --> 01:45:49,886
- Any more?
- No, sir.

1668
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:51,386
He's right here.

1669
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,680
Buddha bean.

1670
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:56,100
Sir, I'm Colonel Steve Lockjaw.

1671
01:45:56,184 --> 01:45:57,476
I'm not to be fucked with.

1672
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,353
You got information for me,
spit it out.

1673
01:46:00,063 --> 01:46:01,980
I saw a car,
a gray van heading north,

1674
01:46:02,064 --> 01:46:03,190
up Craw Creek Road.

1675
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,193
- Carrying?
- Couldn't tell.

1676
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:07,319
White man driving,
Black girl passenger.

1677
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:09,447
North.

1678
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:13,033
What's in these hills?

1679
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:15,536
Sisters of the Brave Beaver.

1680
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:16,662
Who are they?

1681
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:19,332
They grow weed.
They're nuns.

1682
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,627
Is that some kind of sick joke on God?

1683
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:23,961
I'm not joking.

1684
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:27,006
How many women?

1685
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:29,341
I don't know. A bunch.
Ten or 20.

1686
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:32,302
Weapons?

1687
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:34,555
I think they're vegetarian.

1688
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,060
Men, let's do what we do.

1689
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:43,064
Delta-Two, this is Delta-One.

1690
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:44,398
We need to pull imagery.

1691
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:47,068
Mountain chain,
ten kilometers northwest. How copy?

1692
01:47:27,524 --> 01:47:28,984
Hands, hands, hands!

1693
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:54,594
Dismissed.

1694
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:10,568
Come closer.

1695
01:49:47,497 --> 01:49:50,251
If this doesn't line up, you'll go free.

1696
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:55,256
But if it does line up...

1697
01:49:56,881 --> 01:49:58,551
if this is a straight line...

1698
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,177
you got a problem.

1699
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:06,475
What is it?

1700
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:08,269
It's your future.

1701
01:50:34,627 --> 01:50:35,962
How old are you now?

1702
01:50:41,344 --> 01:50:42,345
Hm?

1703
01:50:43,304 --> 01:50:46,056
You're 16 or 17.
It's either one of those.

1704
01:50:51,604 --> 01:50:53,104
You have a boyfriend?

1705
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:54,814
I don't have anything to say to you.

1706
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:56,317
You're too young
to have a boyfriend,

1707
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:57,234
so the answer's no.

1708
01:50:57,318 --> 01:50:58,819
Don't answer for me.

1709
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:01,822
<i>It all makes sense.</i>

1710
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:04,074
You snag her out of the high school.

1711
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:08,537
Find her phone. Curb stomp that.

1712
01:51:10,997 --> 01:51:12,957
But then you fumble her
on the 90-yard line

1713
01:51:13,042 --> 01:51:15,502
at some stank-ass nunnery? Mm!

1714
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,546
That's gotta hurt.

1715
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:20,382
You help me, I'll help you.

1716
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:23,386
You give me Pat Calhoun...

1717
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,180
the Rocket Man, Ghetto Pat...

1718
01:51:28,224 --> 01:51:30,725
and I'll let you go home,
and I'll let you save that little girl.

1719
01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:33,145
You know she's with the Colonel, right?

1720
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:37,942
By "home"...

1721
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,027
I do mean federal prison for you.

1722
01:51:49,994 --> 01:51:51,204
Did you rape her?

1723
01:51:56,167 --> 01:51:57,627
Do you think you're my daughter?

1724
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:01,673
Did you love her?

1725
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:05,051
Answer me!

1726
01:52:05,136 --> 01:52:06,929
Do you think you're my daughter?

1727
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:08,471
It doesn't matter what that test says.

1728
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,056
I have a father, and it's not you.

1729
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,643
Is that what you call a father?
He wasn't enough for your mother.

1730
01:52:12,725 --> 01:52:14,145
How's he gonna be enough for you?

1731
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:15,770
Hm?

1732
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:27,240
<i>Where is he?</i>

1733
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:30,828
I swear, I don't know. I don't know.

1734
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:32,203
Deandra,
you know how many people

1735
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:34,539
sit across from me and swear to God...

1736
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:37,167
they don't know?

1737
01:52:38,293 --> 01:52:39,920
"I swear to God,
I don't know."

1738
01:52:41,713 --> 01:52:43,798
I swear to God...

1739
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:47,011
if you do know, we can save that girl.

1740
01:52:47,845 --> 01:52:49,889
The girl didn't do anything,
and I don't know.

1741
01:52:49,971 --> 01:52:51,474
I don't know where he is.

1742
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:53,850
If I knew where he was, I would
tell you. I don't know where he is.

1743
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:55,226
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1744
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,436
Where is he?

1745
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,314
Save yourself, go to prison,

1746
01:52:58,396 --> 01:53:01,358
I'll take it to the Colonel,
you save the girl.

1747
01:53:01,442 --> 01:53:03,985
Those are your options.
You're in a lose-lose,

1748
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:06,488
maybe-save-your-life position.

1749
01:53:13,828 --> 01:53:16,582
You should put on more makeup
to make yourself look better.

1750
01:53:19,292 --> 01:53:22,796
You go to a dance, you make an effort.

1751
01:53:23,588 --> 01:53:25,131
You put on more makeup.

1752
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,307
Why is your shirt so tight?

1753
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:43,609
I'm not gay,
if that's what you're sayin'.

1754
01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:44,859
I didn't say that.

1755
01:53:44,944 --> 01:53:46,654
I'm not a homosexual.

1756
01:53:46,737 --> 01:53:47,863
I did not say that,

1757
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:49,698
but I see the lifts in your shoes.

1758
01:53:50,533 --> 01:53:54,494
Oh, you are a smartass.
You... Oh, yeah, yeah.

1759
01:53:54,578 --> 01:53:58,082
You just, you're just a little princess,
aren't you?

1760
01:53:58,164 --> 01:54:00,833
Smart mouth. Like your mother.

1761
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:03,420
Your mother had a smart mouth,
and I buried her.

1762
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:14,890
Are you having trouble
remembering what you just read?

1763
01:54:14,974 --> 01:54:16,766
If it's a straight line,
I have a problem.

1764
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,143
If it's not, you have to let me go.

1765
01:54:18,226 --> 01:54:21,145
God, there's no way I'm actually yours,
'cause I can actually fucking read.

1766
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:23,189
You shut up.
Just shut up!

1767
01:54:23,274 --> 01:54:25,484
You fucking mutt!

1768
01:54:44,545 --> 01:54:45,921
Uh-oh.

1769
01:55:06,065 --> 01:55:07,067
Get my vehicle.

1770
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:09,028
Put my kid in the car.

1771
01:55:14,198 --> 01:55:17,493
Just never thought this fucker
would come back for us, you know?

1772
01:55:20,038 --> 01:55:22,707
I got lazy, man.
I wasn't payin' attention.

1773
01:55:27,962 --> 01:55:30,173
I thought the person comin'
through that door one day

1774
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:32,801
was gonna be her mom,
not this fuckin' asshole.

1775
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:35,261
Hm.

1776
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:38,556
See her daughter, you know,
she'd teach her girl stuff,

1777
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:41,894
she'd do her hair, she'd...

1778
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:45,730
be a mom.

1779
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:52,695
I can't do her hair, man.

1780
01:55:53,988 --> 01:55:55,157
You know that?

1781
01:55:57,242 --> 01:55:59,036
I don't know how to do her hair right.

1782
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:00,371
Well...

1783
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:07,543
Don't go dark on me, Bob.

1784
01:56:12,131 --> 01:56:13,216
I won't.

1785
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,470
I'm here. I'm here.

1786
01:56:18,721 --> 01:56:20,515
Bring it down, bro.

1787
01:56:21,475 --> 01:56:22,725
Motherfucker.

1788
01:56:24,353 --> 01:56:25,186
Here he comes.

1789
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:33,112
Put this in your backpack.

1790
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:48,167
Guess this is the end of the line, huh?

1791
01:56:49,877 --> 01:56:51,255
Not for you.

1792
01:56:52,338 --> 01:56:55,634
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

1793
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:00,764
I gotta ditch you, Kemosabe.

1794
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,682
- What?
- You gotta hit it on foot.

1795
01:57:02,765 --> 01:57:04,309
- On foot?
- Yeah.

1796
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:06,936
Here we go.

1797
01:57:07,938 --> 01:57:11,358
I'm gonna turn at this gas station,
I'm gonna slow down,

1798
01:57:11,442 --> 01:57:13,777
and you tuck and roll.
I'll take it from there.

1799
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:14,903
Unbuckle and get ready.

1800
01:57:14,987 --> 01:57:16,654
- Tuck and roll.
- Yeah.

1801
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:17,655
Okay.

1802
01:57:18,532 --> 01:57:20,701
- You know what freedom is?
- What?

1803
01:57:21,452 --> 01:57:24,203
No fear.

1804
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:27,332
Just like Tom fuckin' Cruise.

1805
01:57:29,877 --> 01:57:31,837
Okay. Jump on four. One...

1806
01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:35,423
...two...

1807
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,676
Give me the gun!

1808
01:57:39,677 --> 01:57:41,305
...three...

1809
01:57:41,387 --> 01:57:43,931
Go! Go!

1810
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:44,891
Four!

1811
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:46,350
Slow down!

1812
01:57:46,435 --> 01:57:49,104
Go! Four, Bob!

1813
01:57:49,188 --> 01:57:51,023
Go, four!

1814
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,780
Get up! We're leaving.

1815
01:59:32,666 --> 01:59:35,627
Making up for lost time?
Little daddy-daughter games?

1816
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:37,128
Daddy-daughter games?

1817
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:45,929
I am a Christmas Adventurer!

1818
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:47,722
Do you know what that is?

1819
01:59:47,805 --> 01:59:49,099
No!

1820
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:51,225
I have a higher calling.

1821
01:59:55,396 --> 01:59:59,650
It is a higher honor than having you.

1822
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:42,069
Contact, contact! 12 o'clock!

1823
02:01:29,533 --> 02:01:31,451
I loved her, in case you were wonderin'.

1824
02:01:34,121 --> 02:01:37,248
Best goddamn-looking witch I ever saw.

1825
02:01:37,332 --> 02:01:38,375
Shut up.

1826
02:01:38,457 --> 02:01:40,042
Yeah, she was possessed.

1827
02:01:40,127 --> 02:01:41,920
- Shut the fuck up.
- She was insane.

1828
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:43,880
Like you. You have it in you.

1829
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:45,256
I smelled it from within her,

1830
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,632
and I can smell it from within you.

1831
02:01:46,716 --> 02:01:47,801
She was a fucking rat.

1832
02:01:47,884 --> 02:01:51,512
She was a warrior,
a righteous warrior of freedom!

1833
02:01:51,595 --> 02:01:53,640
And she fought the weak!

1834
02:01:53,724 --> 02:01:55,100
She was a fucking rat!

1835
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:57,935
Huh? Huh?

1836
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,313
You should respect your mother
and your father both.

1837
02:02:01,564 --> 02:02:03,442
Poke your fuckin' eyes out.

1838
02:03:11,176 --> 02:03:12,385
Avanti.

1839
02:03:13,427 --> 02:03:14,845
How's the bounty business?

1840
02:03:15,971 --> 02:03:17,349
It's all right.
How's it with you?

1841
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,559
Things could be better.

1842
02:03:19,643 --> 02:03:22,020
It's not one thing,
it's a-fuckin'-nother.

1843
02:03:22,104 --> 02:03:23,563
Do you find that to be true?

1844
02:03:25,649 --> 02:03:26,983
Anyway...

1845
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:29,694
I need to dispose of this one.

1846
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:32,363
Who is it?

1847
02:03:32,447 --> 02:03:34,615
Murder suspect. Wetback half-breed.

1848
02:03:34,698 --> 02:03:37,327
Involved in narco cartels.
Nobody that will be missed.

1849
02:03:38,286 --> 02:03:39,912
That's a kid. I don't do kids.

1850
02:03:39,996 --> 02:03:41,206
Kids do bad shit.

1851
02:03:42,832 --> 02:03:43,707
Why don't you do it?

1852
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:45,460
I can't do it. I'm busy.
So who can do it?

1853
02:03:45,543 --> 02:03:46,837
Well, get Erik Garrow to do it.

1854
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,046
I don't want Erik Garrow to do it.

1855
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,006
I'll pay you double your daily rate,
get this done.

1856
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:52,050
I don't give a shit. I'm not doin' it.

1857
02:03:52,134 --> 02:03:53,217
All right.

1858
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:56,762
You know the 1776,

1859
02:03:56,846 --> 02:03:58,890
about five miles outside Del Rio
by Walter's Landing?

1860
02:03:58,974 --> 02:04:00,141
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1861
02:04:00,225 --> 02:04:02,351
You get her to them,
I'll pay you your daily rate.

1862
02:04:22,497 --> 02:04:23,622
Smart aleck.

1863
02:04:52,359 --> 02:04:54,904
You got no manners, God damn it!

1864
02:04:55,822 --> 02:04:57,532
You weren't raised right!

1865
02:04:59,283 --> 02:05:00,868
You see that?!

1866
02:05:00,952 --> 02:05:02,244
You see that?!

1867
02:05:03,997 --> 02:05:05,664
That's what your mother brought up.

1868
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:12,130
Get... there.

1869
02:05:12,213 --> 02:05:14,131
Kick all the way.
Yeah, go ahead, kick!

1870
02:05:14,216 --> 02:05:16,384
Kick, kick!

1871
02:05:16,467 --> 02:05:18,427
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

1872
02:05:18,511 --> 02:05:21,765
If you had any manners,
we might have gotten to know each other.

1873
02:05:36,488 --> 02:05:38,030
Little bitch child.

1874
02:05:38,864 --> 02:05:40,242
Bitch child.

1875
02:05:41,784 --> 02:05:43,036
All goddamn witches...

1876
02:05:47,082 --> 02:05:50,335
Where the fuck
are you taking me, asshole?

1877
02:05:51,252 --> 02:05:53,337
Someone gonna come by lookin' for you?

1878
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,842
I said, is someone gonna
come by lookin' for you?

1879
02:06:00,886 --> 02:06:02,096
Yeah.

1880
02:06:03,347 --> 02:06:06,268
They're gonna find me,
and they're gonna fuck you up.

1881
02:06:15,193 --> 02:06:17,279
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Come on.

1882
02:06:18,529 --> 02:06:21,032
Fuck! Fuck!

1883
02:06:29,541 --> 02:06:32,836
<i>Hola, hola.</i>

1884
02:06:53,648 --> 02:06:54,940
Head.

1885
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:05,409
All right, lift your shirt
and turn around.

1886
02:07:07,619 --> 02:07:09,288
Put your hands on top of your head.

1887
02:07:11,541 --> 02:07:13,001
All right, let's go to work.

1888
02:07:14,586 --> 02:07:16,796
Do not move.
Do you have any weapons on you, sir?

1889
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,088
No, sir.

1890
02:07:18,172 --> 02:07:19,548
Why are you running from us?

1891
02:07:20,716 --> 02:07:22,217
Had a long day, ma'am.

1892
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:23,636
You didn't see the lights back there?

1893
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,804
Yes, I did.

1894
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:26,639
What did you toss out of the vehicle?

1895
02:07:26,722 --> 02:07:27,681
'Scuse me?

1896
02:07:27,765 --> 02:07:29,475
What did you toss
out of the vehicle back there?

1897
02:07:30,476 --> 02:07:32,479
- Trash.
- You sure about that?

1898
02:07:32,561 --> 02:07:33,563
Yes, ma'am.

1899
02:07:33,645 --> 02:07:35,148
You been drinking today?

1900
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:37,359
- I've had a few.
- A few what?

1901
02:07:37,442 --> 02:07:39,277
Few small beers.

1902
02:08:08,014 --> 02:08:09,015
There you are.

1903
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:11,643
I see you.

1904
02:08:11,725 --> 02:08:12,976
I see you.

1905
02:08:14,645 --> 02:08:16,855
I got you, motherfucker, I got you.

1906
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:21,903
Faster, you fuckin' piece of shit! Go!

1907
02:08:34,623 --> 02:08:35,958
Who's this asshole?

1908
02:08:38,837 --> 02:08:40,046
What do you want?

1909
02:09:33,891 --> 02:09:35,059
Is that from Lockjaw?

1910
02:09:49,908 --> 02:09:51,201
We got a body.

1911
02:09:55,997 --> 02:09:57,372
<i>Copy, copy.</i>

1912
02:10:01,293 --> 02:10:02,753
Thanks, wagon-burner.

1913
02:10:37,412 --> 02:10:38,957
Fuck.

1914
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:43,293
Fuck.

1915
02:10:44,671 --> 02:10:48,298
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1916
02:10:48,382 --> 02:10:49,716
God damn it.

1917
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:54,012
Fuck. Fuck!

1918
02:12:49,671 --> 02:12:51,506
Hey, fuckstick, what are ya doin'?

1919
02:12:54,007 --> 02:12:56,219
Hey, Red, I know you hear me.

1920
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:59,680
That firewater's
got you fuckin' retarded.

1921
02:13:46,476 --> 02:13:47,729
Oh, God.

1922
02:14:15,547 --> 02:14:18,467
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

1923
02:14:18,551 --> 02:14:20,136

Green..."

1927
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,773
Willa!

1928
02:15:44,511 --> 02:15:45,887
Fuck.

1929
02:16:00,862 --> 02:16:02,654
Please, please. Okay. Okay.

1930
02:19:42,625 --> 02:19:43,626
Fuck!

1931
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:09,902
"Green Acres,
Beverly Hillbillies,

1932
02:20:09,985 --> 02:20:11,529
and Hooterville Junction!"

1933
02:20:13,988 --> 02:20:14,906
What?!

1934
02:20:14,989 --> 02:20:17,493
"Green Acres,
Beverly Hillbillies,

1935
02:20:17,575 --> 02:20:19,202
and Hooterville Junction!"

1936
02:20:19,286 --> 02:20:20,453
I don't know...

1937
02:20:20,995 --> 02:20:22,414
Say it!

1938
02:21:38,199 --> 02:21:39,365
Willa?

1939
02:21:41,619 --> 02:21:42,536
Willa!

1940
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,038
"Green Acres,
Beverly Hillbillies,

1941
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:45,956
- and Hooterville Junction!"
- No, no, no, baby, it's me.

1942
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:46,957
Willa, it's...

1943
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,834
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,
and Hooterville Junction!"

1944
02:21:49,918 --> 02:21:51,670
Okay! Okay!

1945
02:21:53,004 --> 02:21:54,548
It's your dad, Willa!

1946
02:21:56,634 --> 02:21:59,469
"Will no longer be
so goddamn relevant." Look at me.

1947
02:22:02,431 --> 02:22:03,974
Who are you?

1948
02:22:06,184 --> 02:22:07,519
It's your dad!

1949
02:22:10,104 --> 02:22:11,147
Look at me.

1950
02:22:12,023 --> 02:22:14,400
It's okay. It's okay.

1951
02:22:19,739 --> 02:22:21,532
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1952
02:22:21,617 --> 02:22:24,787
Are you okay?
Come on. Go to the car. Go!

1953
02:22:36,674 --> 02:22:38,174
Let's go. Let's go.

1954
02:22:51,980 --> 02:22:53,273
Oh, my God.

1955
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:01,489
You're okay now. You're okay.

1956
02:23:47,119 --> 02:23:48,662
Do you know a Black militant

1957
02:23:48,745 --> 02:23:51,165
by the name of Perfidia Beverly Hills?

1958
02:23:51,247 --> 02:23:53,041
- Yes, I do.
- Uh-huh.

1959
02:23:53,125 --> 02:23:56,295
And was she a member of the rebel group
known as the French 75?

1960
02:23:56,378 --> 02:23:58,047
- She was.
- Yeah.

1961
02:24:00,424 --> 02:24:01,717
Colonel Lockjaw...

1962
02:24:03,635 --> 02:24:06,721
did you engage in a romantic
relationship with this woman?

1963
02:24:13,436 --> 02:24:15,314
Gentlemen...

1964
02:24:15,397 --> 02:24:19,442
I have engaged the enemy
face-to-face in battle.

1965
02:24:19,525 --> 02:24:23,781
And in the dark alleys
and shadows of espionage.

1966
02:24:26,742 --> 02:24:30,620
I was once raped in reverse.

1967
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:35,416
Raped in reverse?

1968
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:41,965
Could you explain how that might work
for us, Colonel Lockjaw?

1969
02:24:42,049 --> 02:24:45,511
The enemy employed deception.
I was drugged.

1970
02:24:46,719 --> 02:24:48,471
And while unconscious...

1971
02:24:49,932 --> 02:24:52,016
my brain was not working.

1972
02:24:53,477 --> 02:24:56,854
But my power was,
and I believe it was taken advantage of.

1973
02:24:59,148 --> 02:25:00,525
What kind of proof do you have?

1974
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:02,778
If you were unconscious,
how do you know this to be true?

1975
02:25:02,861 --> 02:25:04,905
I don't know it to be true,
but I suspect it.

1976
02:25:04,987 --> 02:25:07,865
When I awoke, there was sensitivity
in a private place,

1977
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:10,451
and there was some residue
of an interaction.

1978
02:25:12,328 --> 02:25:13,871
Interaction?

1979
02:25:14,415 --> 02:25:16,165
I believe she was a sperm thief.

1980
02:25:18,877 --> 02:25:20,045
A semen demon.

1981
02:25:20,129 --> 02:25:21,212
That's correct.

1982
02:25:21,296 --> 02:25:22,588
Colonel Lockjaw,

1983
02:25:23,506 --> 02:25:26,801
what would be the purpose
of the enemy raping you in reverse?

1984
02:25:29,179 --> 02:25:31,807
They saw the power of my mind and body.

1985
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:34,143
They desired it.

1986
02:25:44,903 --> 02:25:46,405
Congratulations, Steve.

1987
02:25:48,781 --> 02:25:50,783
You're a Christmas Adventurer.

1988
02:25:50,868 --> 02:25:53,202
Oh, Mommy. Thank you, sir.

1989
02:25:54,328 --> 02:25:56,665
Let me show you around
southwest headquarters.

1990
02:25:56,747 --> 02:25:57,958
- Sure.
- Should we go for a walk?

1991
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:59,001
Yes, sir.

1992
02:25:59,084 --> 02:26:02,004
First stop on the tour, your new office.

1993
02:26:02,086 --> 02:26:03,172
Oh, my.

1994
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,217
You know, if I'm being honest, Sandy,

1995
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:10,012
there was a minute there where
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

1996
02:26:10,094 --> 02:26:12,306
Lockjaw, we're lucky to have you.

1997
02:26:12,388 --> 02:26:14,475
Now, obviously, goes without saying,

1998
02:26:14,558 --> 02:26:17,394
this is just one place
where you can hang your hat,

1999
02:26:17,477 --> 02:26:20,272
take meetings,
stow a few personal items.

2000
02:26:20,354 --> 02:26:23,399
We like our members to feel
they have a home away from home,

2001
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:24,650
any time, day or night.

2002
02:26:24,735 --> 02:26:26,319
That's a fine idea.

2003
02:26:26,403 --> 02:26:29,781
Now, it's empty right now,
but we'll let you personalize it.

2004
02:26:29,864 --> 02:26:31,867
A man's taste defines him, doesn't it?

2005
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:33,326
It does indeed, sir.

2006
02:26:33,409 --> 02:26:35,787
And here we are.

2007
02:26:35,870 --> 02:26:37,371
Suite 55.

2008
02:26:40,791 --> 02:26:42,002
Look at that view.

2009
02:26:43,836 --> 02:26:45,129
Would you look at that?

2010
02:26:46,756 --> 02:26:48,382
- May I?
- Absolutely.

2011
02:26:56,015 --> 02:26:58,769
Damn it. I forgot your keys.

2012
02:26:58,852 --> 02:27:00,395
Wait here, I'll just grab 'em
from my office.

2013
02:27:00,478 --> 02:27:01,647
Yes, sir.

2014
02:28:11,717 --> 02:28:14,552
<i>I've been holding on
to something for a while now</i>

2015
02:28:14,636 --> 02:28:16,846
<i>and I wanted to give it to you.</i>

2016
02:28:17,806 --> 02:28:19,057
<i>Okay?</i>

2017
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:23,102
And I didn't give it
to you before because I...

2018
02:28:24,313 --> 02:28:27,941
I just didn't wanna
expose you to certain stuff.

2019
02:28:28,024 --> 02:28:29,817
You know, I didn't want you to feel...

2020
02:28:31,153 --> 02:28:33,447
sad or confused about it.

2021
02:28:35,699 --> 02:28:37,825
I don't know.
I don't know what I wanted. I wanted...

2022
02:28:38,451 --> 02:28:40,162
I wanted to protect you.

2023
02:28:42,331 --> 02:28:44,498
<i>From all your mom's shit.</i>

2024
02:28:45,334 --> 02:28:47,293
<i>From all my shit.</i>

2025
02:28:48,503 --> 02:28:52,466
<i>I just, I suppose I wanted to be the one</i>

2026
02:28:52,549 --> 02:28:55,135
<i>that you came to for help, right?</i>

2027
02:28:55,218 --> 02:28:56,802
<i>You know, the one,</i>

2028
02:28:57,679 --> 02:29:00,765
<i>the cool dad
that you could say anything to.</i>

2029
02:29:02,768 --> 02:29:05,561
<i>Even though I know that's impossible.</i>

2030
02:29:06,772 --> 02:29:08,481
<i>But I don't want...</i>

2031
02:29:08,565 --> 02:29:12,027
<i>I don't wanna lie to you
about anything anymore.</i>

2032
02:29:15,363 --> 02:29:16,489
And I've been holdin' on to somethin'

2033
02:29:16,573 --> 02:29:19,283
for a couple years now
and I just wanna...

2034
02:29:19,368 --> 02:29:21,202
I just wanna give it to you.

2035
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:23,789
Okay, I'm gonna share this with you

2036
02:29:23,871 --> 02:29:27,667
and if you wanna see it, you can see it.

2037
02:29:29,002 --> 02:29:30,045
Do you wanna see it?

2038
02:29:30,128 --> 02:29:31,754
I don't know what it is, Dad.

2039
02:29:32,547 --> 02:29:34,424
- You don't know what it is?
- No.

2040
02:29:37,343 --> 02:29:39,470
It's a letter.

2041
02:29:41,347 --> 02:29:42,974
It's a letter from your mom.

2042
02:29:45,602 --> 02:29:47,396
Is it for me or for you?

2043
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:53,777
It's for you.

2044
02:30:12,461 --> 02:30:13,879
You wanna go read it alone?

2045
02:30:13,963 --> 02:30:15,340
Go ahead.

2046
02:30:29,729 --> 02:30:31,189
<i>Dear Charlene...</i>

2047
02:30:32,190 --> 02:30:34,860
<i>Hello from the other side
of the shadows.</i>

2048
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:37,529
<i>I don't mean to shock you,</i>

2049
02:30:37,611 --> 02:30:40,239
<i>but I've been contemplatin'
writin' you for a long time.</i>

2050
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:46,163
<i>I often wake up and I find it
completely crazy how</i>

2051
02:30:46,245 --> 02:30:49,623
<i>and why I am where I am today.</i>

2052
02:30:49,708 --> 02:30:51,959
<i>And disconnected from my family.</i>

2053
02:30:53,879 --> 02:30:55,797
<i>I pretended my whole life.</i>

2054
02:30:57,131 --> 02:30:59,425
<i>I pretended to be strong...</i>

2055
02:30:59,509 --> 02:31:01,343
<i>pretended to be dead.</i>

2056
02:31:03,095 --> 02:31:06,933
<i>Is it too late for us,
after all my lies?</i>

2057
02:31:09,019 --> 02:31:10,436
<i>Are you happy?</i>

2058
02:31:12,147 --> 02:31:13,481
<i>Do you have love?</i>

2059
02:31:15,691 --> 02:31:17,778
<i>What will you do when you get older?</i>

2060
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:22,740
<i>Will you try to change
the world, like I did?</i>

2061
02:31:24,533 --> 02:31:25,744
<i>We failed.</i>

2062
02:31:27,245 --> 02:31:28,621
<i>But maybe you will not.</i>

2063
02:31:30,372 --> 02:31:32,917
<i>Maybe you will be the one
who puts the world right.</i>

2064
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:38,340
<i>I think of you every single day...</i>

2065
02:31:38,423 --> 02:31:40,299
<i>every single day.</i>

2066
02:31:41,843 --> 02:31:44,470
<i>And I wish I had been strong
for the both of us.</i>

2067
02:31:46,681 --> 02:31:48,058
<i>I know someday...</i>

2068
02:31:49,141 --> 02:31:51,352
<i>when it's right and it's safe...</i>

2069
02:31:52,395 --> 02:31:53,979
<i>you will find me.</i>

2070
02:31:55,315 --> 02:31:57,359
<i>Please send a kiss to your dad...</i>

2071
02:31:58,527 --> 02:31:59,903
<i>my Ghetto Pat.</i>

2072
02:32:01,237 --> 02:32:04,532
<i>Love, your mom, Perfidia.</i>

2073
02:32:32,727 --> 02:32:35,354
<i>How do I get this flash to work?</i>

2074
02:32:35,438 --> 02:32:37,566
It's not gettin' my face.

2075
02:32:37,648 --> 02:32:39,109
Huh?

2076
02:32:39,191 --> 02:32:41,486
I don't know how to get it...
to get my face.

2077
02:32:41,569 --> 02:32:44,573
Swipe up,
and then there's a lightning bolt.

2078
02:32:44,656 --> 02:32:47,950
And then on there, it says,
"Flash auto on and off."

2079
02:32:48,033 --> 02:32:48,909
No.

2080
02:32:48,994 --> 02:32:50,953
Well, if you push the...

2081
02:32:51,037 --> 02:32:52,872
There's a little...

2082
02:32:52,956 --> 02:32:55,083
There's a little circle
on the bottom right side.

2083
02:32:55,165 --> 02:32:56,501
Click that.

2084
02:32:56,584 --> 02:32:58,420
Okay. Or take it with the back.

2085
02:32:58,503 --> 02:32:59,837
I guess that's fine.

2086
02:32:59,921 --> 02:33:01,630
- <i>QST, QST.</i>
- I gotta press the circle.

2087
02:33:01,715 --> 02:33:04,675
<i>This is N6EDG,
the Whiskey Sour in Oakland.</i>

2088
02:33:04,759 --> 02:33:07,344
<i>QST signal from
the Whiskey Sour in Oakland.</i>

2089
02:33:07,429 --> 02:33:09,180
Did they say Oakland?

2090
02:33:09,263 --> 02:33:10,890
Yeah.

2091
02:33:10,974 --> 02:33:13,894
<i>Repeat, MKU raids in progress.</i>

2092
02:33:13,977 --> 02:33:16,854
<i>Meeting point for protesters
is Lincoln Park.</i>

2093
02:33:16,938 --> 02:33:19,190
<i>QST, this is the Whiskey Sour.</i>

2094
02:33:19,273 --> 02:33:22,318
<i>All hands on deck. N6EDG.</i>

2095
02:33:22,402 --> 02:33:25,697
You know, Oakland's
a three-and-a-half-hour drive from here.

2096
02:33:25,780 --> 02:33:26,781
Yeah.

2097
02:33:26,864 --> 02:33:28,657
You know that's far, right?

2098
02:33:28,742 --> 02:33:29,950
Well, it's raining out.

2099
02:33:31,411 --> 02:33:32,245
Hey!

2100
02:33:33,621 --> 02:33:34,496
Be careful.

2101
02:33:34,581 --> 02:33:35,873
I won't.
