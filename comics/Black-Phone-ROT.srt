1
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:05,700
Hello?

2
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:09,671
Hope. Hope Adler.

3
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:11,606
Who is this?

4
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,978
Alpine Lake.

5
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:20,582
It-it's a youth camp
in the mountains.

6
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,789
I, um...

7
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:31,860
I had these dreams.

8
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,064
Seven numbers.

9
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:37,833
No area code,
so this call is local.

10
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:40,969
You're here in Colorado, right?

11
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,876
The numbers were carved in ice.

12
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:50,879
Yes.

13
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,049
Yes.

14
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:58,121
Who is this?

15
00:01:58,154 --> 00:01:59,988
Who are you?

16
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:04,726
Hello?

17
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,063
Hello? Can you hear me?

18
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:09,898
Hello?

19
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,057
<i>Fight! Fight!</i>

20
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,226
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

21
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,759
Fight! Fight! Fight!

22
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,970
Got to get up, man.

23
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,506
Finn!

24
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,840
Finn!

25
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:00,243
You're hurting him!

26
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:01,776
Finney!

27
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,146
Please, stop. Please.

28
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,015
You done yet?

29
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,551
Yes.

30
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:10,186
Stay the fuck away from me.

31
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:19,528
Anyone else?

32
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:31,274
Hey.

33
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,510
What the hell was that?

34
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:35,977
New kid.

35
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,480
Are you just beating up
new kids now?

36
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:38,880
He started it.

37
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,882
What was it this time?

38
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:42,385
Uh, the usual.

39
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:45,354
"Heard you were the badass
that wasted a serial killer.

40
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:46,555
You don't look so tough."

41
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,989
He didn't really say that.

42
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:50,959
Yeah, he actually did.

43
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:53,029
Did you have to go
so hard on him?

44
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:55,930
In a situation like that,

45
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:59,035
the more blood, the better--
for the crowd.

46
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:00,303
Proves a stronger point.

47
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,271
You've made that point
more than once,

48
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:04,440
so maybe--
and I'm just spitballing here--

49
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:06,342
maybe the point
you're actually making

50
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,278
is less "don't fuck with me"
and more "I'm the guy to beat."

51
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:12,381
Hey, Gwen, Finn.

52
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:13,848
Great fight, man.

53
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:15,151
Thanks, Ernesto.

54
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,951
-Hi, Ernie.
-So, uh, tonight,

55
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,953
uh, I'm going to go down
to the Civic Center

56
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:20,889
to wait in line
for Duran Duran tickets.

57
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:22,591
-Duran Duran tickets?
-He just said that.

58
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,394
Simon Le Bon is so choice.

59
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:28,064
A-Are you going, Gwen?

60
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:30,199
I wish.
Those tickets cost a mint.

61
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:32,401
My treat.
I was gonna buy two anyway.

62
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,070
It'd, you know, be cool

63
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:36,605
to have someone to go with
who's... who's also a fan.

64
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,940
-For real?
-For real.

65
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,276
That'd be radical.

66
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:41,943
Consider it done.

67
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,247
All right, well,
I-I got to get to shop class.

68
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,415
See ya.

69
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,320
You know that's a date.

70
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:54,256
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, it is.

71
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,958
Okay, so what if it's a date?

72
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:01,597
I don't know, I...
I just don't like him.

73
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,366
I don't get why.

74
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,899
He's really nice.

75
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,502
Besides that,
don't you think Robin

76
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,371
would want you looking out
for his kid brother?

77
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:11,040
But that doesn't mean letting
him boink my little sister.

78
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:12,907
-Ow.
-Don't be gross, jizz mopper.

79
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:16,512
Welcome back to <i>Night Flight.</i>

80
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:18,114
Here's German band FEX

81
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:20,649
with their new hit,
"Subways of Your Mind."

82
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:27,623
Night, son.

83
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:29,924
I'm off to bed.

84
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,660
Night.

85
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:33,928
Don't stay up too late.

86
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:36,132
Yeah, sure.

87
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:36,025
If you try to touch me,
I'll scratch your face.

88
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:43,098
This face?

89
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,245
Hey.

90
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:05,454
Still not my thing.

91
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:07,590
Don't tell Dad.

92
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:09,091
Fuck off, slap-dick.

93
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,392
I'm no narc.

94
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:15,631
You okay?

95
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,266
I'm fine.

96
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,135
No, I-I mean...

97
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,204
I don't want to talk about it.

98
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,578
It's okay
that you feel this way.

99
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:33,549
You don't know how I feel.

100
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:38,220
No, but...

101
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:41,557
I know, however you feel,
it's okay.

102
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,587
Hey, what are you doing?

103
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:28,624
Hey.

104
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,194
Hey, Gwen.

105
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,898
Gwen, wake up. What are you...

106
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,800
Why are you so cold?

107
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,303
Finn?

108
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:43,972
It's okay.

109
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,607
You were sleepwalking again.

110
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,412
Jesus. Your skin is like ice.

111
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,682
I had a bad dream.

112
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,822
It's okay.
Just... go back to bed.

113
00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:02,257
I-I said I had a bad dream.

114
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,693
I heard you.
Just go back to bed.

115
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:14,837
Hey, witch.

116
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:26,515
Hey, Gwen.

117
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:29,052
Hey, Ernie.

118
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,886
Check it out.

119
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,354
Oh, choice.

120
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:34,389
I can't believe it.

121
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:37,493
So, uh, you're into
a lot of that...

122
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:40,362
that woo-woo stuff, right?

123
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:42,431
What? You mean ghosts?

124
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:45,267
Spirits?
Glimpses of the world beyond?

125
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:48,537
-Yeah.
-Okay, then.

126
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,673
Yeah, I believe in
all that woo-woo stuff.

127
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:55,944
Cool.

128
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:59,748
Uh, I-I brought you
something else.

129
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,552
Ernesto, is this <i>lotería?</i>

130
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:04,520
Yeah.

131
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:06,522
My <i>abuela</i> sells them
in her shop,

132
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:08,524
and I thought they looked cool.

133
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:10,492
They're like tarot.

134
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:11,794
These are beautiful.

135
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,829
I mean, you can use them
like tarot.

136
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:17,533
If you have the sight,
they can show you things.

137
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:20,669
And you have that, right?

138
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:21,870
Have what?

139
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:24,740
Oh, I mean, like, you have...
you have dreams and stuff,

140
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:27,576
and they...
they show you things?

141
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,747
Where did you hear that?

142
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:35,517
My parents.

143
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:37,452
Back, you know,
they said that the police got

144
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:40,089
an anonymous call where...

145
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,925
where, um, Robin's body was.

146
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:45,861
But they say it was you.

147
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:49,098
That you dreamed it.

148
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,100
Or-or something.

149
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,502
I don't like talking about that.

150
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:57,073
Mm, why not?

151
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:59,142
'Cause it's weird.

152
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:00,742
I'm weird.

153
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,680
Maybe I like weird.

154
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:32,474
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

155
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,011
Hello?

156
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:58,314
Hello?

157
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:00,782
Who's this?

158
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,617
Hope. Hope Adler.

159
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:05,354
Who is this?

160
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,823
My name is Gwen.

161
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:10,159
Where are you calling from?

162
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,628
Alpine Lake.

163
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:16,832
It-it's a youth camp
in the mountains.

164
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:19,634
How did you get this number?

165
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:23,306
I, um... I had these dreams.

166
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,674
Seven numbers.

167
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:28,010
No area code,
so this call is local.

168
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:30,113
You're here in Colorado, right?

169
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:31,613
Yes.

170
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,885
The numbers were carved in ice.

171
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,154
By boys.

172
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,988
Underwater.

173
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:41,990
Yes. Yes.

174
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:45,694
I had the same dreams,
but the boys carved letters.

175
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,997
Who is this?

176
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:50,032
Who are you?

177
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,235
My name is Gwen.

178
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:54,170
Hello?

179
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:55,937
I-I said my name is Gwen.

180
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,307
Hello? Can you hear me?

181
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,721
You shouldn't be here.

182
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,052
Hey.

183
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:45,054
Hey, Gwen.

184
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,222
Gwen.

185
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:53,362
Am I really here?

186
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,730
You're okay.

187
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:58,833
You were sleepwalking again.
You came here in your sleep.

188
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:01,070
I heard you leave,
and I followed you.

189
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:05,740
I feel like I'm crazy.
What the hell?

190
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:07,143
-Hey, hey. Look at me. Hey, hey.
-What the hell?!

191
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:09,844
You're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

192
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:14,983
I-I was on the phone.

193
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:18,187
Finn.

194
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:22,124
I was talking to Mom.

195
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:27,230
It was just a dream.

196
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,098
N-No, it was...

197
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:32,368
a dream, yeah, but it was her.

198
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,337
She called me.

199
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,372
From a youth camp.

200
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:38,341
A youth camp?

201
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:42,944
She reached out to me
from there for a reason.

202
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,316
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

203
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:19,015
-What's this?
-Camp Alpine Lake.

204
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:21,417
The camp Mom called from.

205
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,817
We have to go there.

206
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:25,421
Gwen, stop this.

207
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:27,889
It was just a dream.

208
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,258
About a real place.

209
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:31,260
A place I found.
It's why I had the dream.

210
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:33,296
It's a Christian youth camp

211
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:34,863
up near Silverthorne.

212
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,198
What's this?

213
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:37,899
They're accepting
applications for CITs

214
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,435
for middle school winter camp.

215
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:40,935
What's a CIT?

216
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:43,072
Counselor in training.

217
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:45,341
No...

218
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:48,210
I'm not going to be a counselor
for junior highers

219
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:50,313
at some weird Jesus camp
you dreamed about.

220
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:53,049
No, you're going to be
a counselor in training.

221
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:54,883
-No, I'm not.
-Come on.

222
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,585
Dad has been hounding you
to get a job,

223
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,054
and this is a job that pays.

224
00:21:58,087 --> 00:21:59,355
And we can find out what Mom...

225
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:00,523
I said no.

226
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,327
What's going on in here?

227
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,365
Uh, Gwen wants us to get jobs
at some Christian winter camp.

228
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,968
Not Camp Alpine.

229
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,639
Hmm.

230
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,341
Your mother worked there.

231
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,378
Wh-When?

232
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:26,015
Uh, it was
long before I met her.

233
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,018
It closed in '58.

234
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:31,487
How'd you hear about this place?

235
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,589
Uh, um, I-I had...

236
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,224
Some kids at school.

237
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:38,960
Said it was a good way
to, uh, make some money.

238
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,897
Christian camp.

239
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,370
You guys, you know I don't...

240
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:49,971
much like any of that
religion stuff, you know?

241
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:52,441
It-it's just a job, Dad.

242
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,648
Mom worked there.

243
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,883
I'm not crazy.

244
00:23:03,185 --> 00:23:05,887
I never said you were crazy.

245
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:09,658
Don't let me hear
you took that thing

246
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:12,128
any faster than 55.

247
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,396
Y-Yes, sir.

248
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:15,398
I would like my daughter back
unscathed.

249
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:18,067
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

250
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:21,270
Do you say anything else?

251
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:22,538
Yes, sir.

252
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,340
Uh, uh, I-I mean...

253
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:28,511
I don't like the way
he looks at her.

254
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:30,413
Yeah. Me, neither.

255
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,482
Damn it. Wait.

256
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:36,118
"Wait," what?

257
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:49,131
Good.

258
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:51,300
Go look after your sister.

259
00:23:53,002 --> 00:23:54,670
Do me a favor while I'm gone.

260
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,572
Yeah, anything, son.

261
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,940
Don't get drunk.

262
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,444
Hey, come on.

263
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:04,747
When are you gonna believe
I'm done with all of that?

264
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,716
In two weeks,
I get my three-year chip.

265
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,186
I'll have it when you get back.

266
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:13,088
See you in a few weeks.

267
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:15,057
Okay. Great.

268
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,060
Finally get some peace and quiet
around this place.

269
00:25:43,145 --> 00:25:44,813
I can't see the road.

270
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,216
This isn't safe.

271
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:50,185
We could drive off a cliff
and not even see it.

272
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:53,656
Stop the car.

273
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:57,092
What are you doing?

274
00:25:57,126 --> 00:25:58,661
I'm gonna run
in front of the car

275
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:00,863
so I can see the road.

276
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:02,698
Just follow me.

277
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:21,450
Follow me!

278
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,692
Mando!

279
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:32,294
I found your stray CITs.

280
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:44,707
Straight ahead about 20 yards.

281
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,642
Park anywhere.

282
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:52,748
Thank you.

283
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:53,916
You must be the Blakes.

284
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:55,384
Yeah, how'd you know?

285
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,720
Oh, they closed I-6
at Silverthorne.

286
00:26:57,753 --> 00:27:00,823
You're the only ones
who didn't get the call in time.

287
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:02,291
I'm Armando.

288
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:04,293
Or just Mando, if you like.

289
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:07,262
Come on. Come with me.
Let's get you inside.

290
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:10,499
What about all the kids?

291
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:12,768
Aren't they supposed
to arrive tomorrow?

292
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,770
Camp's canceled.

293
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:18,440
They won't plow the roads
until the storm passes.

294
00:27:18,474 --> 00:27:20,843
How many people made it here?

295
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:22,511
Just you three.

296
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:25,347
Support staff has only
been here a week,

297
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:27,349
but otherwise, you're it.

298
00:27:27,383 --> 00:27:30,653
I'm sorry to say it,
but for now you're stuck here.

299
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:44,366
Come on, Gwen.

300
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,369
You're with me.

301
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:50,339
This is it.
Take any bunk you want.

302
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:54,476
Heaters are on,
so just give 'em a few minutes.

303
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,247
It will be toasty in no time,
all right?

304
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,549
Have a good night, kids.
Sweet dreams.

305
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:02,618
<i>I got to sleep in here alone?</i>

306
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:04,253
Afraid so.

307
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:05,821
State law requires
separate housing

308
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:07,756
for male and female minors.

309
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,258
I'd stay in here with you,

310
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:12,194
but I'm not a registered
counselor, so no can do.

311
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:17,332
But my cabin is just over there,
if you need anything.

312
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,803
Night.

313
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:12,507
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

314
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:40,969
Who is this?

315
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:30,619
Hello?

316
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:31,920
Is anyone there?

317
00:32:31,954 --> 00:32:34,456
Hello, Finney.

318
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:15,697
Hell is not flames, Finney.

319
00:33:16,332 --> 00:33:17,666
It's ice.

320
00:33:29,012 --> 00:33:33,049
Nothing burns like the cold.

321
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,835
Gwen. Gwen!

322
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,306
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen!

323
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,940
Hey, Gwen, Gwen, look at me!

324
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:01,210
Hey, hey, look at me!
Wake up! Wake up!

325
00:34:01,244 --> 00:34:03,779
Hey, hey.

326
00:34:03,812 --> 00:34:06,648
What's happening to me?

327
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,617
Oh, God, I feel crazy.

328
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,851
You were dreaming. You're okay.

329
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:11,653
-You're okay.
-I feel crazy.

330
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:13,322
You're okay. You're okay.

331
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:20,063
You're okay. You're okay.

332
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:21,763
You're okay.

333
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:55,064
Gwen.

334
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,801
I had a bad dream.

335
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:03,672
Okay. Y-You... you all right?

336
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:10,612
Here, uh... lie down.

337
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:34,836
Jesus...

338
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,207
please don't let me have
another dream tonight.

339
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:40,042
Please.

340
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,246
Hey.

341
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:46,015
Y-You okay?

342
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,450
Yeah.

343
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:49,784
Did I wake you?

344
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,754
No.

345
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:57,026
Was that for real?

346
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:59,028
What?

347
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:03,032
You talk to Jesus
just like that?

348
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:05,901
Yeah.

349
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:08,337
You think it's weird?

350
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:11,040
Uh, no. No, not-not at all.

351
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:14,809
I th... I think it's hot.

352
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:19,182
You think it's hot
that I talk to Jesus?

353
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:22,485
Yeah. I mean, it might even
be hotter if you called him

354
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:24,853
Jesús.

355
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:27,789
You know, my mom is
Catholic as hell.

356
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:31,093
She'd love me dating
somebody who prays.

357
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:34,996
We're dating?

358
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:38,767
Uh, um, I mean, I was...
I was just saying that...

359
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,070
I'm a good Christian girl?

360
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:44,106
Sure.

361
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,840
Why not?

362
00:36:48,944 --> 00:36:51,147
My mom was Christian, too.

363
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:55,884
Dad didn't want us brought up
in the church, but...

364
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,187
I asked a lot of questions.

365
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:03,192
And when he wasn't around,
she answered.

366
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,129
Did she know
about your dream thing?

367
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:11,267
I got it from her.

368
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:15,204
It drove her crazy.

369
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:20,009
I'm scared the same thing
will happen to me.

370
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:23,512
It won't.

371
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:25,880
You're too strong for that.

372
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:35,024
You don't think I'm a freak?

373
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:38,860
What's wrong with being a freak?

374
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:41,063
I'm a freak like my mom.

375
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:45,101
Were you close to her?

376
00:37:45,134 --> 00:37:47,336
Yeah.

377
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,172
I think about her every day.

378
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:53,042
I can still see her face
so clearly.

379
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:56,279
She was beautiful.

380
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,916
I think... you're beautiful.

381
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,927
What about me?
Do you think I'm beautiful?

382
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,563
Finn, you rotting shit stain.

383
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:17,500
Have you been listening
this whole time?

384
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:21,203
Well, I'm still right here,

385
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:24,140
so it's not like
I had any choice.

386
00:38:25,574 --> 00:38:27,876
I-I thought he was asleep.

387
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:30,346
Told you Duran Duran is a date.

388
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:49,098
Ernesto, I need to talk
to Gwen alone.

389
00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:53,202
If it's about last night,
he knows.

390
00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:54,203
Knows what?

391
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:55,904
Why do you think he's here?

392
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:57,939
He came to help us investigate.

393
00:38:57,972 --> 00:39:00,076
Wait, you told him
about your dreams?

394
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:03,346
Hmm. Yeah, Finn,
I know about her dreams.

395
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:05,947
And about the calls
that you get.

396
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:08,950
-Gwen.
-We can trust him.

397
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:12,621
Okay, but it wasn't
yours to tell.

398
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,156
Okay, I haven't told anyone.

399
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,890
Because you don't have
any friends.

400
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:18,427
I... I have friends.

401
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:19,662
Name one.

402
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,230
One you've brought home
to hang out.

403
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:23,932
One you've even mentioned
in a conversation at all.

404
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:26,102
Gwen, it wasn't yours to tell.

405
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:28,037
I have to tell somebody, Finn.

406
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,971
You never want to hear
about my dreams.

407
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:32,341
-That's not true.
-See this?

408
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:35,244
This happened last night
in my dream.

409
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:39,115
One of the kids grabbed me.

410
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:41,983
In... in your dream?

411
00:39:42,017 --> 00:39:44,520
-Gwen, this is bad.
-Morning, campers!

412
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:49,225
Another glorious God-given day
here at Camp Alpine Lake.

413
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:51,127
Breakfast in the mess hall.

414
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,262
Come get some grub!

415
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:19,921
News reports say this is
the worst blizzard since '46.

416
00:40:20,756 --> 00:40:22,291
Denver is shut down.

417
00:40:22,324 --> 00:40:24,959
Best-case scenario is
two days, maybe three.

418
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:27,029
It could be longer.

419
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:28,431
You've met my niece Mustang.

420
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:32,000
She works the stables
and in the kitchen with me.

421
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:34,370
Mustang? Like the car?

422
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:37,206
Like the horse.

423
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:42,478
Uh, how many other people
are here?

424
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:45,714
Just Kenneth and Barbara,
who run the offices.

425
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:47,716
Rest of the support staff
got out

426
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,586
before they closed the roads.

427
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:53,756
So, how did everyone sleep?

428
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,091
-Fine.
-Fine.

429
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:58,694
I noticed you slept
with the boys.

430
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:01,564
I can lose my camp license
for that. Don't do it again.

431
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:08,237
Now, for the $64,000 question:

432
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,307
Why are you guys here?

433
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:15,110
To be camp CITs.

434
00:41:15,144 --> 00:41:16,512
No, I...

435
00:41:16,545 --> 00:41:18,547
I get that.

436
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:21,484
I mean, none of you
ever attended here as campers,

437
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:25,421
and none of you listed churches
on your applications,

438
00:41:25,454 --> 00:41:28,491
so that means you didn't get
one of our flyers.

439
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:33,162
So, why are you here?

440
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:41,403
Huh?

441
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:50,279
Our mom went here.

442
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:53,749
Oh. Camper or counselor?

443
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:56,285
Counselor.
Her name was Hope Adler.

444
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:58,053
"Was"?

445
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:00,589
She died seven years ago.

446
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:03,025
Mm. I'm sorry.

447
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,427
Do you remember her?

448
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:08,531
A lot of kids come through here.

449
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:11,634
Do you know her camp name?

450
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:15,504
Support staff and counselors,
they get camp names.

451
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:19,542
It's easier for the campers
to remember who's who.

452
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:26,315
Starlight.

453
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:29,785
You're Starlight's kids?

454
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:32,388
You do remember her.

455
00:42:33,222 --> 00:42:34,390
Very well.

456
00:42:34,423 --> 00:42:37,459
Sh-She was a true light,
that one.

457
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,567
Um, I-I'm sorry you lost her.

458
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:49,605
May I ask how she passed?

459
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:54,243
She killed herself.

460
00:42:56,812 --> 00:43:00,215
I-I... I'm so sorry.

461
00:43:05,454 --> 00:43:08,123
Look, I...

462
00:43:08,157 --> 00:43:10,659
I-I'm just glad
you guys found us.

463
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:14,163
After you eat,
you should call your families

464
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:16,332
and let 'em know you're okay.

465
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:19,401
There's a phone
in the camp offices.

466
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:21,904
Wait, what about
the outside pay phone?

467
00:43:21,937 --> 00:43:24,540
That thing's deader than disco.

468
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:26,709
Hasn't worked in over a decade.

469
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:36,552
That dead pay phone rang
last night.

470
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:38,621
Did you answer it?

471
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:40,289
Yeah.

472
00:43:40,322 --> 00:43:41,890
I'm pretty sure it was him.

473
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:43,592
Him?

474
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:45,694
Like, "him" him?

475
00:43:45,728 --> 00:43:46,895
Oh, my God.

476
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:48,631
What'd he say?

477
00:43:48,664 --> 00:43:51,667
What'd he want?

478
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:55,704
-What?
-It's ringing again?

479
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:59,408
Go call Dad.
I'll meet you when I'm done.

480
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:10,185
You got something to say?

481
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:12,354
Then say it.

482
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:14,556
It's cold here.

483
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,560
Who is this?

484
00:44:20,262 --> 00:44:22,297
I don't remember.

485
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:24,967
What happened to you?

486
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,202
We don't know.

487
00:44:27,236 --> 00:44:29,338
You don't remember anything?

488
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:30,873
There's three of us.

489
00:44:30,906 --> 00:44:33,375
Okay. Where are you?

490
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,910
It's cold here.

491
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,712
It's cold where?

492
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,748
And it's dark here.

493
00:44:41,383 --> 00:44:43,252
Tell me where you are.

494
00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:45,187
We don't know.

495
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:48,924
My name is Finn.

496
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:50,859
Help us, Finn.

497
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,663
You have to try
to remember something.

498
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:56,932
How did you die?

499
00:44:56,965 --> 00:44:59,735
We don't remember.

500
00:44:59,768 --> 00:45:01,770
We're scared, Finn.

501
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:03,605
I understand.

502
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:06,608
-Okay, what do you...
-We're not supposed to be here.

503
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:09,411
What do you mean?

504
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:11,346
This isn't where we belong.

505
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,816
We weren't supposed to be here.

506
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:18,721
Something bad happened to you?

507
00:45:18,754 --> 00:45:21,857
Help us. Please help us.

508
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,759
Tell me.

509
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:25,427
Tell me how I can help.

510
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:26,795
Find us, Finn. Please, Finn.

511
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:28,731
-Help us! Please come find us!
-Come find us!

512
00:45:28,764 --> 00:45:29,898
You have to come find us!

513
00:45:29,932 --> 00:45:32,468
We don't want to be here!

514
00:45:50,953 --> 00:45:53,422
Yeah,
we're snowed in here, as well.

515
00:45:53,455 --> 00:45:55,324
You guys just hold tight.

516
00:45:55,357 --> 00:45:57,826
I'm sure they'll have you
out of there in no time.

517
00:45:59,062 --> 00:46:00,829
Love you, kid.

518
00:46:02,564 --> 00:46:03,732
Bye.

519
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:11,540
Welcome back to KMGH News.

520
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:14,077
The blizzard brought
the entire area to a standstill

521
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,979
as heavy winds and drifts
made all the roads impassable.

522
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:19,314
So much so that police

523
00:46:19,348 --> 00:46:20,649
in several cities issued curfews

524
00:46:20,682 --> 00:46:23,352
against the vehicles
being on the road.

525
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:25,354
And the restrictions still stand

526
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:27,422
to those who violate
the order...

527
00:46:27,456 --> 00:46:29,092
Yeah, Jake, hey.

528
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:31,960
Listen, I need to call in
that favor.

529
00:46:31,994 --> 00:46:36,431
Has the company fleet
finished plowing the property?

530
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,445
Excuse me.

531
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:54,316
Do you have any literature
on the history of Alpine Lake?

532
00:46:56,052 --> 00:46:59,555
Uh, we have a brochure.

533
00:47:00,156 --> 00:47:02,858
Damn. Nothing more in-depth?

534
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:07,496
No, there is no published
history of Camp Alpine Lake.

535
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:10,066
We are a youth camp,
not a historical society.

536
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:12,868
Barbara, these are guests.

537
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:14,570
No, Kenneth,

538
00:47:14,603 --> 00:47:16,471
this is the young lady
who decided

539
00:47:16,505 --> 00:47:20,576
to sneak into the boys' cabin
last night.

540
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:22,845
So, what exactly
can we help you with, sweetie?

541
00:47:22,878 --> 00:47:26,448
Look, we just want to know
about some kids

542
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:30,819
that may have been
killed here in the past.

543
00:47:30,853 --> 00:47:32,955
You don't need to hear
anything about that.

544
00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:34,756
We don't?

545
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,992
You don't.

546
00:47:37,026 --> 00:47:39,428
Philippians 4:8 tells us

547
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:41,597
to think on things
that are lovely.

548
00:47:42,232 --> 00:47:44,499
Philippians 4:8 also says
to think on things

549
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:47,569
that are true, just and honest,
right, Barb?

550
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:49,638
Barbara.

551
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:52,008
We don't know the specifics.

552
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:55,144
This is not some haunted tour
or ghost camp.

553
00:47:55,178 --> 00:47:56,879
This is
a Christian organization.

554
00:47:56,912 --> 00:47:58,847
We don't discuss
those kinds of things here.

555
00:47:58,881 --> 00:48:01,917
But some fucked-up shit
did happen here, right?

556
00:48:02,918 --> 00:48:06,555
Have you always had
such a filthy, vulgar mouth?

557
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:09,491
Have you always been
such a sanctimonious twat?

558
00:48:09,524 --> 00:48:13,595
Hey, hey, I-I think
you two should leave now.

559
00:48:15,164 --> 00:48:16,832
Let's go.

560
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:19,935
I'll pray for you.

561
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:45,894
Hello?

562
00:48:45,928 --> 00:48:47,930
Who is this?

563
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:49,564
Hope.

564
00:48:49,598 --> 00:48:51,833
Uh, Hope Adler.

565
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:53,236
Who is this?

566
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:55,504
I can't see you.

567
00:48:55,537 --> 00:48:56,905
Where are you?

568
00:48:56,939 --> 00:48:58,740
Alpine Lake.

569
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:03,612
It's a youth camp
in the mountains.

570
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:05,547
It's so dark.

571
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,683
How did you find me?

572
00:49:07,716 --> 00:49:10,219
I had these dreams.

573
00:49:10,253 --> 00:49:12,587
Seven numbers.

574
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:15,824
No area code,
so this call is local.

575
00:49:15,857 --> 00:49:18,027
You're here in Colorado, right?

576
00:49:19,128 --> 00:49:21,463
Where were the numbers?

577
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:24,533
The numbers were carved in ice.

578
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:26,001
The ice of a lake?

579
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:28,837
Yes. Yes.

580
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,274
It's so hard
to remember things here.

581
00:49:31,307 --> 00:49:33,209
It's so cold and dark.

582
00:49:33,242 --> 00:49:35,844
Who is this?

583
00:49:35,877 --> 00:49:37,679
Who are you?

584
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:39,681
We don't remember.

585
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:41,516
Hello?

586
00:49:42,285 --> 00:49:44,253
Hello? Can you hear me?

587
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:49,558
We're not supposed to be here.

588
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:16,212
Ernesto!

589
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:17,813
Wake up!

590
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,645
You don't
have to answer it, man.

591
00:51:51,414 --> 00:51:53,149
Yes, I do.

592
00:51:55,884 --> 00:51:59,721
You have one job:
look after my sister.

593
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:02,325
I promise.

594
00:52:35,824 --> 00:52:37,859
Hello, Finney.

595
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:43,166
What do you want?

596
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:48,437
It took me a long time,
but now I remember.

597
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:50,772
You're dead.

598
00:52:50,805 --> 00:52:52,908
Oh, Finney.

599
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:57,280
You of all people know

600
00:52:57,313 --> 00:53:00,116
that "dead" is just a word.

601
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,755
Tell me why you're here.

602
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,692
Why do you think I'm here?

603
00:53:11,494 --> 00:53:13,962
'Cause you knew we'd be trapped.

604
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:17,300
Gwen?

605
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:20,269
Gwen! Gwen!

606
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:29,005
Did you think
that our story was over, Finney?

607
00:54:30,006 --> 00:54:34,843
Did you really believe
you could do what you did to me

608
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:36,545
and that would be the end of it?

609
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:38,547
I'm not afraid of you.

610
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:40,283
And why should you be?

611
00:54:40,316 --> 00:54:41,983
You killed me.

612
00:54:42,018 --> 00:54:44,387
You won.

613
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,887
Tell me what you want.

614
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,458
What I have always
wanted with you.

615
00:54:49,492 --> 00:54:50,925
What?

616
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:52,927
You want to scare me?

617
00:54:55,398 --> 00:54:58,567
You know as well as I do

618
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:02,904
that fear is just the warm-up.

619
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:06,275
Gwen!

620
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:08,943
-Gwen!
-Hey!

621
00:55:08,977 --> 00:55:11,347
Hey! What are you doing?

622
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:14,317
It's 3:00 in the morning.

623
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,884
G-Gwen isn't in her dorm.

624
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:17,486
I don't know where she is.

625
00:55:53,988 --> 00:55:56,392
Have you guessed what it is yet?

626
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,931
What it is that I want from you?

627
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:09,004
<i>"Want" isn't even</i>
<i>the right word.</i>

628
00:56:09,038 --> 00:56:13,275
<i>It's more of an insatiable need.</i>

629
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,946
<i>So, have you got it yet?</i>

630
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:19,415
<i>No?</i>

631
00:56:19,448 --> 00:56:22,884
<i>Fine.</i>
<i>I'll just tell you, Finney.</i>

632
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:28,290
<i>What I want is this.</i>

633
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:36,065
I want to hurt you

634
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:40,001
in ways that
you can't even imagine.

635
00:56:40,035 --> 00:56:44,973
You will pay
for what you did to me.

636
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:49,378
You made me kill my brother,

637
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:55,084
the person on earth
that I loved the most!

638
00:56:55,117 --> 00:56:58,053
And then you killed me!

639
00:56:59,288 --> 00:57:04,260
<i>So now I am</i>
<i>going to destroy you, Finney...</i>

640
00:57:06,028 --> 00:57:10,166
<i>...by destroying</i>
<i>the thing you love most.</i>

641
00:57:11,734 --> 00:57:16,639
<i>Vengeance is mine.</i>

642
00:57:53,642 --> 00:57:56,178
Gwen! Gwen!

643
00:58:02,384 --> 00:58:04,986
Gwen!

644
00:58:22,638 --> 00:58:24,306
Help me!

645
00:58:25,074 --> 00:58:26,242
Help me!

646
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,281
Hey. Hey. Hey, Gwen.

647
00:59:05,314 --> 00:59:07,616
Gwen, wake up. Gwen, wake up.

648
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:10,819
Gwen, are you awake?

649
00:59:10,853 --> 00:59:13,055
Gwen, are you awake?

650
00:59:15,257 --> 00:59:17,159
Hey.

651
00:59:20,296 --> 00:59:22,097
You awake?

652
00:59:25,301 --> 00:59:28,203
You got the devil in you, child.

653
00:59:47,323 --> 00:59:51,393
I've been on this earth
a lot of years.

654
00:59:51,427 --> 00:59:54,430
Seen a lot of things
I can't explain.

655
00:59:54,463 --> 00:59:56,432
But I've never heard of anyone
who got dreams

656
00:59:56,465 --> 00:59:58,567
like the ones you describe.

657
00:59:58,601 --> 01:00:00,235
Where do you think
they come from?

658
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:01,737
She's possessed.

659
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,806
My God, Mando, isn't it obvious?

660
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,742
I'm not possessed,
you judgmental cunt wagon.

661
01:00:08,777 --> 01:00:10,279
You think this is funny,
Mustang?

662
01:00:10,312 --> 01:00:12,648
You getting your horns clipped?

663
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:13,916
Yeah, I do.

664
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:15,184
Why don't you mind
your own business?

665
01:00:15,217 --> 01:00:16,619
Why don't you stop acting like

666
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:18,487
this is the first creepy shit
you've seen up here?

667
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,622
Stop it.

668
01:00:19,655 --> 01:00:21,323
Every single one of us

669
01:00:21,357 --> 01:00:23,826
has seen or heard things
around here.

670
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:25,761
-You especially, Barb.
-Barbara.

671
01:00:25,794 --> 01:00:27,396
Shut up, both of you.

672
01:00:28,263 --> 01:00:31,734
Gwen, your dreams,

673
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:34,637
are you saying
they tell you the future?

674
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:37,606
Sometimes.

675
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,943
Other times, it's the dead
showing me things from the past.

676
01:00:40,976 --> 01:00:42,378
What kind of things?

677
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:45,280
Like the smallest missing boy.

678
01:00:46,281 --> 01:00:47,416
Felix?

679
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:51,520
He was running for his life,
wearing a yellow down parka.

680
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:54,723
A-And the tallest kid,
he wore a white parka.

681
01:00:54,757 --> 01:00:56,392
Spike.

682
01:00:56,425 --> 01:01:00,829
And scratched letters
into the ice above him: "WBH."

683
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,267
I think his head was cut in half
on the tree stump in the woods.

684
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,669
Lord in heaven.

685
01:01:06,702 --> 01:01:08,971
The third boy wore
a denim jacket.

686
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:11,440
He was all burnt up,

687
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:13,776
like he'd been cooked
inside an oven.

688
01:01:15,344 --> 01:01:17,312
-How'd you know that?
-Mando.

689
01:01:17,346 --> 01:01:18,981
No.

690
01:01:19,015 --> 01:01:22,985
Gwen, ignore everyone else
in the room.

691
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:25,587
It's just you and me right now.

692
01:01:25,621 --> 01:01:29,658
The boy who was burnt up,
how did you hear about that?

693
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,227
I just told you.

694
01:01:32,261 --> 01:01:34,363
He came to me in my dream.

695
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:36,331
He wants me to find him.

696
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:37,566
They all do.

697
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,635
They can't rest
until they're found.

698
01:01:39,668 --> 01:01:42,438
-Whoa. You okay there, Mando?
-Mando?

699
01:01:45,274 --> 01:01:49,912
Burnt pieces of
Calvin O'Keefe's denim jacket

700
01:01:49,945 --> 01:01:51,814
were found by police.

701
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:54,283
Only they had that detail.

702
01:01:54,316 --> 01:01:56,952
The police,
the former camp owner and me.

703
01:01:56,985 --> 01:01:59,722
What about
what we saw in the kitchen?

704
01:01:59,755 --> 01:02:02,324
That was no dream.

705
01:02:02,357 --> 01:02:03,892
Have you heard of The Grabber?

706
01:02:03,926 --> 01:02:05,794
Yeah. Who hasn't?

707
01:02:05,828 --> 01:02:08,430
He killed a bunch of kids,
and then...

708
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:10,699
got killed when one escaped.

709
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:13,736
Yeah, h-his name was
Finney something.

710
01:02:18,074 --> 01:02:19,808
Finney Blake.

711
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,745
Finn Blake?

712
01:02:23,912 --> 01:02:26,682
Holy shit.

713
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:31,620
Gwen, when did all this start?

714
01:02:31,653 --> 01:02:35,424
Weeks ago, when my mom called me
from this camp in a dream.

715
01:02:35,457 --> 01:02:36,892
She wanted me to come here.

716
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:39,862
Wh-What does this have to do
with The Grabber?

717
01:02:39,895 --> 01:02:42,297
It wasn't the devil
attacking me in the kitchen.

718
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:43,599
It was him.

719
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:45,901
I could see him. He's here.

720
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:49,705
This is from the last year
of camp before we closed down.

721
01:02:49,738 --> 01:02:52,674
I-I was just the camp cook
back then.

722
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:56,545
There's me,
and there's your mom.

723
01:02:57,446 --> 01:03:01,984
After Harlan, the owner,
closed this place,

724
01:03:02,018 --> 01:03:04,520
I kept coming up here anyway,

725
01:03:04,553 --> 01:03:07,790
hiking the area,
looking for those kids.

726
01:03:09,491 --> 01:03:11,593
Then, when Harlan passed,
I bought this place

727
01:03:11,627 --> 01:03:14,763
in an estate sale for a song
and reopened it.

728
01:03:14,797 --> 01:03:16,865
I promised their parents
I wouldn't stop looking

729
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:18,467
until I found them.

730
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:22,071
So, every day,
weather permitting,

731
01:03:22,105 --> 01:03:25,607
I'm still out
walking the trails,

732
01:03:25,641 --> 01:03:27,676
digging up every mound of dirt.

733
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:30,512
Not a single morning goes by
that I don't pray for help

734
01:03:30,546 --> 01:03:32,815
to find those boys.

735
01:03:32,848 --> 01:03:35,551
I didn't know it was you
he'd send.

736
01:03:36,718 --> 01:03:41,423
But now that you're here,
I'm not gonna pass up a chance

737
01:03:41,456 --> 01:03:43,525
to put those kids to rest
once and for all,

738
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:47,563
for-for-for them,
for their families and for me.

739
01:03:48,897 --> 01:03:50,133
No fucking way.

740
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,334
What is it with this family?

741
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:55,504
It's him. It's The Grabber.

742
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:56,972
-Are you sure?
-I know him,

743
01:03:57,006 --> 01:03:58,841
and I know his face.

744
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:01,110
That's Bill.

745
01:04:01,144 --> 01:04:02,845
Wild Bill.

746
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:04,446
He worked maintenance.

747
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:07,616
We called him Wild Bill

748
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:11,386
because he wore this
brown leather tool belt

749
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,855
loose around his waist
like a gunslinger,

750
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:16,658
and he got long, wavy hair
like Wild Bill Hickok.

751
01:04:18,794 --> 01:04:21,097
Wild Bill Hickok.

752
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,865
"WBH."

753
01:04:22,898 --> 01:04:25,101
This is where he started.

754
01:04:25,134 --> 01:04:27,103
These boys were his first kills.

755
01:04:27,136 --> 01:04:28,804
And Wild Bill became
The Grabber.

756
01:04:28,837 --> 01:04:31,840
Mando, when did weird things
start happening around here?

757
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,743
Mm, not until a few years ago.

758
01:04:34,776 --> 01:04:36,545
1978?

759
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:38,181
Sounds about right.

760
01:04:38,214 --> 01:04:40,016
That's the year I killed him.

761
01:04:40,049 --> 01:04:42,417
And his spirit was set free
to come back here.

762
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:44,786
Okay, but why would he do that?

763
01:04:45,554 --> 01:04:48,757
Maybe his spirit draws power
from the fear of his victims

764
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:52,128
because their spirits
are not at rest.

765
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:53,862
How do we find these boys?

766
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:58,901
Their bodies are underwater,
in a frozen lake, I think.

767
01:04:58,934 --> 01:05:00,669
But didn't the police search
the local lakes?

768
01:05:00,702 --> 01:05:02,171
No. Why would they?

769
01:05:02,205 --> 01:05:04,539
The lakes were frozen over
when the boys went missing.

770
01:05:05,974 --> 01:05:09,178
Lake Maru is where
we take campers ice fishing,

771
01:05:09,212 --> 01:05:11,180
so we store our equipment there.

772
01:05:12,748 --> 01:05:15,450
Wild Bill used it
for the kids' hockey games.

773
01:05:15,484 --> 01:05:17,086
He was a good skater.

774
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,488
That's the only lake
where he would have the tools

775
01:05:19,521 --> 01:05:22,191
to make a hole in the ice and...

776
01:05:22,225 --> 01:05:23,759
dump the bodies.

777
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:28,530
Okay, so i-if we find Felix,
Cal and Spike,

778
01:05:28,563 --> 01:05:31,934
allow them to rest, as you say,

779
01:05:31,967 --> 01:05:34,937
that would get rid
of The Grabber's power?

780
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:38,740
I think so. Yeah.

781
01:05:40,243 --> 01:05:41,843
Okay, then.

782
01:05:41,877 --> 01:05:46,949
At dawn, we head to Lake Maru
and look for those boys.

783
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:25,487
Very funny, Mustang.

784
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:42,205
Look what you made me do.

785
01:06:42,238 --> 01:06:45,640
You made me kill my brother.

786
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:54,050
I know you're out there, Bill.

787
01:06:54,716 --> 01:06:57,652
You can't have those boys
forever.

788
01:06:58,987 --> 01:07:03,725
My name's not Bill.

789
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,031
Wild Bill, Grabber.

790
01:07:09,132 --> 01:07:11,034
Evil is evil.

791
01:07:43,732 --> 01:07:46,935
I want

792
01:07:46,968 --> 01:07:51,573
to hurt you.

793
01:07:56,878 --> 01:07:59,348
We are gonna get
those boys back, Bill.

794
01:07:59,382 --> 01:08:02,318
My name's not Bill!

795
01:08:30,413 --> 01:08:32,881
The devil's lettuce
is not allowed

796
01:08:32,914 --> 01:08:35,717
in Camp Alpine property.

797
01:08:37,953 --> 01:08:40,123
So fire me.

798
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:50,233
You've really been through it,
haven't you, kid?

799
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,977
There's... there's a certain
look in a young man's eye.

800
01:09:03,212 --> 01:09:06,149
Kind of, um, quiet fury,

801
01:09:06,182 --> 01:09:07,849
kind of...

802
01:09:07,883 --> 01:09:11,887
deep rage when he's seen
too much or done too much.

803
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:19,794
Get in many fights, Finn?

804
01:09:23,032 --> 01:09:24,200
So?

805
01:09:24,233 --> 01:09:26,801
So, here's what I know.

806
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:31,940
Behind that kind of anger
is fear.

807
01:09:33,808 --> 01:09:35,044
I'm not afraid of anything.

808
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:36,778
I know one thing
you're afraid of.

809
01:09:36,811 --> 01:09:39,182
Yeah? What's that?

810
01:09:39,215 --> 01:09:41,783
That you can't protect
your sister.

811
01:09:45,954 --> 01:09:48,857
When I was on the streets,

812
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,859
I chose the wrong path.

813
01:09:50,892 --> 01:09:54,197
Instead of facing my fears,
I chose anger.

814
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:56,765
You're doing the same.
I can see it.

815
01:09:58,367 --> 01:10:03,239
Finn, son...
this is what I do for a living.

816
01:10:03,272 --> 01:10:07,076
I meet half a dozen kids
like you every year.

817
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:11,013
Kids who are told
this is who they have to be.

818
01:10:12,914 --> 01:10:15,984
You are stronger than you think.

819
01:10:17,386 --> 01:10:19,988
You were strong enough
to kill The Grabber,

820
01:10:20,022 --> 01:10:23,459
and you are strong enough to
let what happened with him go.

821
01:10:28,064 --> 01:10:30,266
I don't know how to do that.

822
01:10:31,267 --> 01:10:33,236
You got to...

823
01:10:33,269 --> 01:10:35,271
face your feelings.

824
01:10:36,038 --> 01:10:39,041
You can't just hold them in
and numb it all out.

825
01:10:39,075 --> 01:10:41,977
You got to face it,
and then you can let it go.

826
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:47,116
He wants to kill Gwen,
to hurt me.

827
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:50,086
Oh, we're not gonna
let that happen.

828
01:11:00,429 --> 01:11:02,565
I'm taking this with me.

829
01:11:02,598 --> 01:11:04,300
Come on, man. I need that.

830
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:07,036
I'm doing you a favor.
This ain't even good shit.

831
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:11,873
We head to the lake
in an hour, at sunup.

832
01:11:11,906 --> 01:11:14,076
Be ready.

833
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:19,075
Me and Ernesto are gonna
take shifts watching you, so...

834
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:22,011
if you have another nightmare,
we'll wake you.

835
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:25,348
What if you can't?

836
01:12:27,316 --> 01:12:29,151
Then fight back.

837
01:12:29,918 --> 01:12:32,154
I mean, it's your dream,
isn't it?

838
01:12:33,589 --> 01:12:36,258
He makes it more than that.

839
01:12:40,995 --> 01:12:43,466
What about those books
you read about dreaming?

840
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,069
You know, there's got to be
something you can try.

841
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:50,139
He's too strong.

842
01:12:55,144 --> 01:12:57,279
I thought that once, too.

843
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:07,289
She's out.

844
01:13:07,323 --> 01:13:09,258
Can I ask you a question?

845
01:13:14,263 --> 01:13:17,133
Did you really talk to my
brother down in that basement?

846
01:13:31,046 --> 01:13:32,615
Yeah.

847
01:13:32,648 --> 01:13:34,049
Yeah, I did.

848
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:36,152
Wh-What'd he say?

849
01:13:36,185 --> 01:13:40,022
He said that your dad didn't
come back from Vietnam

850
01:13:40,055 --> 01:13:42,124
because he couldn't leave
his buddies behind.

851
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:46,228
And that he wasn't gonna
leave me behind.

852
01:13:46,262 --> 01:13:47,929
Yeah?

853
01:13:48,798 --> 01:13:51,933
Yeah, that...
that was Robin all right.

854
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:57,939
Do you think he's still here?

855
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:04,046
I-I don't really know
what's on the other side,

856
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,582
but there's something.

857
01:14:06,615 --> 01:14:08,384
And I hope it's good.

858
01:14:10,152 --> 01:14:12,054
And I hope he's there.

859
01:14:12,087 --> 01:14:14,457
But if he isn't,

860
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:17,393
it's not me
he's here looking after.

861
01:14:20,763 --> 01:14:23,332
Wake me in four hours.

862
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:27,530
Wild Bill.

863
01:15:53,722 --> 01:15:55,691
Nope, nope, no, no.

864
01:15:55,724 --> 01:15:58,193
Y-You're staying in bed tonight.

865
01:18:53,635 --> 01:18:55,671
You look like your mother.

866
01:18:59,374 --> 01:19:01,276
Why is she in here?

867
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,614
A kindness, really.

868
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:09,318
To you, I mean.
A kindness to you.

869
01:19:10,352 --> 01:19:11,754
A kindness?

870
01:19:13,355 --> 01:19:15,424
It's what I can manage.

871
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:21,630
My mom dreamed about
Billy Showalter,

872
01:19:21,663 --> 01:19:23,499
the paperboy.

873
01:19:23,532 --> 01:19:25,801
He was the first kid taken
in our area.

874
01:19:27,402 --> 01:19:29,805
She figured out you took him,
didn't she?

875
01:19:32,075 --> 01:19:34,576
Isn't that obvious?

876
01:19:36,378 --> 01:19:38,914
The kindness here

877
01:19:38,947 --> 01:19:41,917
is me showing you the truth

878
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:44,853
before I do what I have to do.

879
01:19:59,735 --> 01:20:02,337
Abandon all hope,

880
01:20:02,371 --> 01:20:05,340
ye who enter here.

881
01:20:17,086 --> 01:20:19,922
She didn't kill herself.

882
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:25,661
You killed her!

883
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:31,733
No. No, no, no, no.

884
01:20:31,767 --> 01:20:33,136
No, no, no.

885
01:20:33,169 --> 01:20:34,503
No, no.

886
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:36,004
No!

887
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:39,108
What did you do?
What did you do?

888
01:20:39,142 --> 01:20:41,743
What have I done? What have...

889
01:20:41,777 --> 01:20:43,846
No, no!

890
01:20:43,879 --> 01:20:46,515
This is different than a dream.

891
01:20:46,548 --> 01:20:49,918
I conjured this from my hate

892
01:20:49,952 --> 01:20:53,488
and from whatever memories
hell let me keep.

893
01:20:53,522 --> 01:20:58,894
Hell is different
than you think.

894
01:20:58,927 --> 01:21:03,832
They take the best parts of you,
the human parts,

895
01:21:03,866 --> 01:21:09,004
and leave only the worst bits,
only the sins.

896
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:14,476
I am a bottomless pit of sin.

897
01:21:15,944 --> 01:21:20,983
What do you think happens
when you die in this realm?

898
01:21:23,186 --> 01:21:24,887
I'd wake up.

899
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,522
Maybe.

900
01:21:27,556 --> 01:21:30,059
Or perhaps...

901
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:31,927
you just die.

902
01:21:35,497 --> 01:21:36,965
It's time to find out.

903
01:21:57,186 --> 01:21:58,553
Hello?

904
01:21:58,587 --> 01:21:59,788
You have to hide.

905
01:22:45,634 --> 01:22:46,935
Gwen! Gwen!

906
01:22:46,969 --> 01:22:48,003
Wake up!

907
01:22:48,037 --> 01:22:49,105
Gwen!

908
01:22:49,138 --> 01:22:50,839
Gwen, wake up!

909
01:22:50,872 --> 01:22:52,708
Finn! Mustang!

910
01:22:52,741 --> 01:22:53,842
Gwen.

911
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,044
What's wrong with her?

912
01:22:55,078 --> 01:22:56,112
Gwen. Gwen!

913
01:23:10,659 --> 01:23:11,860
Gwen!

914
01:23:11,893 --> 01:23:13,262
Gwen!

915
01:23:13,296 --> 01:23:15,031
-Gwen, wake up!
-Gwen!

916
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:42,657
-Gwen? Gwen, wake up.
-Gwen!

917
01:23:42,691 --> 01:23:43,892
-Gwen, wake up.
-Gwen!

918
01:23:43,925 --> 01:23:45,161
-Gwen, wake up.
-Gwen, wake up!

919
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:47,896
Gwen, wake up!

920
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:49,898
-Gwen, wake up!
-Gwen!

921
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:51,633
Gwen, wake up!

922
01:23:52,868 --> 01:23:55,071
-Hey!
-Gwen!

923
01:24:04,313 --> 01:24:07,749
Ah, naughty girl, Gwen.

924
01:24:08,384 --> 01:24:10,819
Fuck you with a dinosaur dick.

925
01:24:10,852 --> 01:24:14,157
Oh, salty tongue
for a girl so young.

926
01:24:15,857 --> 01:24:17,826
What are you doing?

927
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:19,594
If someone tries to take

928
01:24:19,628 --> 01:24:23,099
what power I do have
away from me,

929
01:24:23,132 --> 01:24:27,702
I have every right
to defend myself.

930
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:30,705
Mando.

931
01:24:35,644 --> 01:24:37,346
Tell the boys I miss them.

932
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:45,887
Mando!

933
01:24:58,434 --> 01:24:59,935
Gwen, wake up!

934
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:26,162
-Gwen!
-Gwen!

935
01:25:40,742 --> 01:25:42,345
-Gwen!
-Keep pressure on it.

936
01:25:42,378 --> 01:25:43,745
Got it.

937
01:25:43,778 --> 01:25:45,248
All right,
help me flip her over.

938
01:25:46,215 --> 01:25:47,283
Gwen.

939
01:25:47,883 --> 01:25:50,785
Gwen, wake up. Gwen?

940
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:53,855
-Gwen?
-Okay.

941
01:25:53,889 --> 01:25:55,424
Gwen, can you hear us?

942
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:57,059
Gwen, wake up.

943
01:25:57,093 --> 01:25:58,427
-Gwen, wake up! -Hey,
keep pressure on the wound.

944
01:25:58,461 --> 01:25:59,861
-Got it.
-Gwen? Gwen, can you hear me?

945
01:25:59,895 --> 01:26:01,330
-Is she breathing?
-Gwen, come on.

946
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:03,199
-You've got to wake up, Gwen.
-Come on. We need help.

947
01:26:03,232 --> 01:26:04,833
Gwen, Gwen, if you can hear me,
you have to fight back!

948
01:26:04,866 --> 01:26:07,170
Gwen, fight back!

949
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:29,091
You didn't bring me here.

950
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:31,127
I brought myself.

951
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,697
I chose to come here,
and I can leave when I want.

952
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:38,833
I understand now.

953
01:26:38,867 --> 01:26:41,470
In a dream, I have power, too.

954
01:26:41,504 --> 01:26:43,272
So?

955
01:26:46,442 --> 01:26:48,511
What are you doing?

956
01:26:48,544 --> 01:26:50,146
Isn't it obvious?

957
01:26:50,179 --> 01:26:53,482
I'm fighting back, you grievous,
festering ass wound.

958
01:26:58,321 --> 01:27:00,722
See you later, Wild Bill.

959
01:27:07,063 --> 01:27:08,197
Mando.

960
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:10,932
Mando!

961
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:22,011
Is he dead?

962
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,815
I found... I found Felix.

963
01:27:27,816 --> 01:27:30,286
I found him. I found Felix.

964
01:27:41,464 --> 01:27:42,931
Mustang?

965
01:27:42,964 --> 01:27:44,533
-What time is it?
-About 4:30.

966
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:46,202
What's happened?
Are you all right?

967
01:27:46,235 --> 01:27:47,136
Yeah, I'm fine.

968
01:27:47,169 --> 01:27:49,338
Mando fell through the ice
on Lake Maru.

969
01:27:49,372 --> 01:27:51,107
Oh, no.

970
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,943
He's okay, but he found one of
the missing boys in the water.

971
01:27:55,944 --> 01:27:58,547
We're all gonna start looking
for the other two at dawn.

972
01:27:58,581 --> 01:28:00,049
We need your help.

973
01:28:00,815 --> 01:28:03,052
Not with that demon child
out there.

974
01:28:04,453 --> 01:28:06,055
Her name is Gwen,

975
01:28:06,088 --> 01:28:08,923
and she is the reason
we got to Mando in time.

976
01:28:08,957 --> 01:28:11,460
That demon child,
she saved his life.

977
01:28:12,094 --> 01:28:14,030
-I-I don't know, Mustang. We...
-You know what?

978
01:28:14,063 --> 01:28:15,964
You want to be all
yellow-bellied and barn-sour,

979
01:28:15,997 --> 01:28:17,899
lock yourself in this room
until it's safe,

980
01:28:17,932 --> 01:28:20,001
you go right ahead.

981
01:28:20,036 --> 01:28:22,837
But that ain't no kind
of true Christian behavior.

982
01:28:27,043 --> 01:28:28,977
Sun's up at 7:00.

983
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:55,037
Gwen!

984
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:57,640
There you are. You okay?

985
01:29:10,952 --> 01:29:13,289
Dad?

986
01:29:13,322 --> 01:29:14,490
Hey, kids.

987
01:29:14,523 --> 01:29:16,125
What are you doing here?

988
01:29:16,858 --> 01:29:19,961
Heard you were snowed in,
so I called in a favor.

989
01:29:19,994 --> 01:29:21,330
Oh, thank God.

990
01:29:21,364 --> 01:29:22,964
We can finally get you
the hell out of here.

991
01:29:22,997 --> 01:29:24,533
We have to stay.

992
01:29:25,134 --> 01:29:27,001
-What?
-What?

993
01:29:27,036 --> 01:29:29,003
We have to stay.

994
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,641
Wh-What's going on?

995
01:29:32,675 --> 01:29:34,443
Our work here isn't done.

996
01:29:34,477 --> 01:29:37,113
He's after her, Dad.

997
01:29:37,146 --> 01:29:40,015
He's... Who-who's "he?"

998
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:42,284
Him.

999
01:29:47,223 --> 01:29:49,325
I don't know...

1000
01:29:49,358 --> 01:29:51,427
Gwen, um...

1001
01:29:53,162 --> 01:29:56,399
-Is this more dream stuff?
-Dad, don't.

1002
01:29:59,068 --> 01:30:01,070
Okay, we're getting out of here.

1003
01:30:01,103 --> 01:30:03,406
-Come on. Let's go.
-I'll get my stuff.

1004
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,274
I'm not going anywhere.

1005
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:07,510
Gwen.

1006
01:30:08,977 --> 01:30:10,279
He's going to kill you.

1007
01:30:10,312 --> 01:30:12,181
Okay, and I can't stop him.

1008
01:30:12,214 --> 01:30:14,183
But we have a chance.

1009
01:30:14,216 --> 01:30:15,684
A chance to protect you,
to keep you safe.

1010
01:30:15,718 --> 01:30:17,686
You're gonna take care
of me, Finn?

1011
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,523
You can't even take care
of yourself.

1012
01:30:20,556 --> 01:30:23,359
You are just like fucking Dad,
putting your head in the sand

1013
01:30:23,392 --> 01:30:25,294
and numbing yourself
into oblivion.

1014
01:30:25,327 --> 01:30:26,162
Whoa.

1015
01:30:26,195 --> 01:30:27,696
Where did that come from?

1016
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:29,432
You've seen
what he's been doing.

1017
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:30,533
You're just ignoring it,

1018
01:30:30,566 --> 01:30:33,068
pretending you don't
smell it on him, in his room,

1019
01:30:33,102 --> 01:30:34,170
-in the backyard.
-Narc.

1020
01:30:34,203 --> 01:30:35,404
You can't narc about

1021
01:30:35,438 --> 01:30:37,173
what everyone already knows,
dingus.

1022
01:30:37,206 --> 01:30:39,442
You're just smoking your
fucking life away to pretend

1023
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:40,643
-none of this happened.
-Shut up.

1024
01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:42,178
Well, it happened, Finn.

1025
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:43,679
-Shut up.
-And it happened to those kids.

1026
01:30:43,712 --> 01:30:45,381
-Shut up.
-And it's happening now.

1027
01:30:45,414 --> 01:30:47,149
And you two just want to run
and hide like you always do.

1028
01:30:47,183 --> 01:30:48,350
-Shut up.
-Bottle, joint.

1029
01:30:48,384 --> 01:30:50,186
-Same fucking Friday night.
-Shut up!

1030
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:52,121
-Anything to stop the pain.
-Shut up!

1031
01:30:52,154 --> 01:30:54,156
Anything to feel for a few hours
like what happened to you

1032
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,392
down in that basement
wasn't real!

1033
01:30:56,425 --> 01:30:57,493
Shut up!

1034
01:30:57,526 --> 01:31:00,496
All right, you don't think
I don't know it was real?

1035
01:31:02,164 --> 01:31:04,999
You think I don't fucking know
it was real?

1036
01:31:07,169 --> 01:31:09,305
It's all I ever think about.

1037
01:31:10,539 --> 01:31:12,041
All right, you don't...

1038
01:31:12,074 --> 01:31:13,609
you don't know
what it was like down there.

1039
01:31:13,642 --> 01:31:15,344
Nobody fucking knows.

1040
01:31:18,614 --> 01:31:20,416
All right, I was...

1041
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:24,019
I was so fucking scared.

1042
01:31:31,227 --> 01:31:34,463
God, I don't want to be
angry anymore.

1043
01:31:50,513 --> 01:31:53,282
I don't want to be
afraid anymore.

1044
01:31:57,653 --> 01:31:59,421
Hey.

1045
01:32:02,258 --> 01:32:05,060
You're the bravest person
I know.

1046
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,202
Okay.

1047
01:32:13,235 --> 01:32:15,671
Gwen, look at me, please.
I know you want to stay.

1048
01:32:15,704 --> 01:32:18,741
I know, but if you really are
in danger here,

1049
01:32:18,774 --> 01:32:21,210
we need to leave right now.

1050
01:32:21,243 --> 01:32:23,646
No.

1051
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:27,416
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
but I'm not asking.

1052
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:29,752
What are you gonna do, Dad?
You gonna beat me?

1053
01:32:29,785 --> 01:32:32,254
Take off your belt
and whip me into the truck?

1054
01:32:32,288 --> 01:32:33,389
Don't, don't...

1055
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:35,558
Go ahead and try.
See if it works.

1056
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:37,293
Your mother, right there.
There's your mother.

1057
01:32:37,326 --> 01:32:39,461
You're just like your mother.

1058
01:32:39,495 --> 01:32:42,431
Stubborn! You're so stubborn
right to the end,

1059
01:32:42,464 --> 01:32:44,266
even in the face of reality.

1060
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,201
The end? The end?

1061
01:32:46,235 --> 01:32:48,370
Let me tell you
about the end, Dad.

1062
01:32:49,204 --> 01:32:51,540
Mom didn't kill herself.

1063
01:32:53,809 --> 01:32:55,244
Okay. That's it.

1064
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:57,179
Let's all get
in the goddamn truck.

1065
01:32:57,212 --> 01:32:59,315
No, no, wait, Gwen.

1066
01:32:59,348 --> 01:33:01,183
What are you talking about?

1067
01:33:02,284 --> 01:33:04,587
Mom's dreams.

1068
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:07,456
She was dreaming about
a missing kid, wasn't she?

1069
01:33:07,489 --> 01:33:09,325
Talking about camp
before she died.

1070
01:33:09,358 --> 01:33:11,393
That's why you remembered
the camp.

1071
01:33:11,427 --> 01:33:13,462
Yeah, but... Yeah, so? So?

1072
01:33:13,495 --> 01:33:16,665
She found him
long before he took Finn,

1073
01:33:16,699 --> 01:33:20,469
and he saw her,
and he came to our house.

1074
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:23,339
No.

1075
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:27,176
Holy shit.

1076
01:33:27,843 --> 01:33:30,446
He showed me that he killed her.

1077
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:34,383
Dad, what was the first thing
you said when you saw Mom?

1078
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:37,152
What?

1079
01:33:37,186 --> 01:33:38,887
You asked her,

1080
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:42,157
"What did you do?
What did you do?"

1081
01:33:42,191 --> 01:33:44,493
And you blamed yourself.

1082
01:33:44,526 --> 01:33:48,197
You said, "What have I done?"

1083
01:33:50,366 --> 01:33:54,203
We were asleep when it happened,
when you found her.

1084
01:33:54,236 --> 01:33:56,372
How else could I know
what you said?

1085
01:33:57,272 --> 01:33:59,541
It wasn't your fault, Dad.

1086
01:33:59,575 --> 01:34:01,777
Oh, my God.

1087
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:03,312
And it wasn't hers.

1088
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:04,647
Oh, my God.

1089
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:08,384
The man who took Finn
took her away from us

1090
01:34:08,417 --> 01:34:10,419
because she was onto him.

1091
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:15,357
Because her dreams
weren't just dreams.

1092
01:34:18,394 --> 01:34:20,429
And neither are mine.

1093
01:34:34,443 --> 01:34:37,179
All right, pass me the cable.

1094
01:34:47,823 --> 01:34:49,725
<i>Hey, Jesus.</i>

1095
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:52,728
<i>I'm not doing so well.</i>

1096
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,364
<i>I need help.</i>

1097
01:34:55,397 --> 01:34:57,399
<i>Some real fucking help.</i>

1098
01:34:58,767 --> 01:35:01,370
<i>We got to find</i>
<i>those other two boys</i>

1099
01:35:01,403 --> 01:35:03,839
<i>to take away his power.</i>

1100
01:35:03,872 --> 01:35:06,442
<i>I'm scared he's gonna kill me.</i>

1101
01:35:07,276 --> 01:35:09,344
<i>For real this time.</i>

1102
01:35:09,378 --> 01:35:11,413
<i>Please don't let that happen.</i>

1103
01:35:11,447 --> 01:35:13,348
<i>Get us out of here alive.</i>

1104
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,585
<i>Don't let him win.</i>

1105
01:35:19,055 --> 01:35:20,756
We're pretty much out of light.

1106
01:35:21,557 --> 01:35:24,860
Maybe Spike and Cal
are down too deep.

1107
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:26,462
I was thinking the same thing.

1108
01:35:26,495 --> 01:35:27,796
We should've seen 'em by now.

1109
01:35:47,449 --> 01:35:49,351
Hey, whoa, girl.

1110
01:35:49,384 --> 01:35:51,453
You've done enough for today.

1111
01:36:05,334 --> 01:36:06,835
Oh, no, Gwen.

1112
01:36:07,836 --> 01:36:09,471
Gwen!

1113
01:36:09,505 --> 01:36:11,306
Gwen, wake up.

1114
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,708
Need some help!

1115
01:36:23,352 --> 01:36:24,820
Hey, Gwen.

1116
01:36:24,853 --> 01:36:26,388
Gwen, wake up.

1117
01:36:26,421 --> 01:36:28,957
Sh-She accidentally fell asleep.

1118
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:30,826
Accidentally, my ass.

1119
01:37:17,005 --> 01:37:18,874
He's here.

1120
01:37:54,177 --> 01:37:56,979
Oh, my God. Ken, Barbara!

1121
01:38:05,687 --> 01:38:08,423
He's still here. Keep looking.

1122
01:38:08,457 --> 01:38:11,060
Where is he? Where did he go?

1123
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,928
The ice is breaking!

1124
01:38:16,065 --> 01:38:17,866
The cable!

1125
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,954
Finn!

1126
01:38:42,658 --> 01:38:44,826
Whoa!

1127
01:38:45,494 --> 01:38:47,629
How the tables have turned.

1128
01:38:52,101 --> 01:38:55,671
Ernesto, get her out of here.

1129
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:07,716
I remember the feeling.

1130
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:10,752
Breathless, scared,

1131
01:39:10,786 --> 01:39:14,090
the whole of the world
starting to fade away.

1132
01:39:14,123 --> 01:39:15,824
I've got Gwen.
Watch out. I'm coming through.

1133
01:39:15,857 --> 01:39:17,859
-You all right?
-Here. Here.

1134
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:27,569
-You got him?
-Yeah. I got him.

1135
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:02,871
"O grave, where is thy victory?

1136
01:40:02,904 --> 01:40:06,042
O death, where is thy sting?"

1137
01:40:10,779 --> 01:40:13,082
Scripture?

1138
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:17,220
God's not here.

1139
01:40:17,253 --> 01:40:18,920
You're alone.

1140
01:40:20,922 --> 01:40:22,191
No.

1141
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:23,925
I brought friends.

1142
01:41:18,081 --> 01:41:20,316
The boys are found.

1143
01:41:20,349 --> 01:41:21,950
You're powerless.

1144
01:41:49,345 --> 01:41:51,847
Oh, you're so fucked.

1145
01:41:52,681 --> 01:41:54,983
Hell isn't flames, Bill.

1146
01:41:55,017 --> 01:41:56,718
It's ice.

1147
01:42:06,362 --> 01:42:08,231
You don't scare me.

1148
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:29,245
Hey.

1149
01:43:29,278 --> 01:43:31,013
You okay?

1150
01:43:45,894 --> 01:43:47,762
You did good, Dad.

1151
01:43:52,301 --> 01:43:53,768
It's over.

1152
01:43:53,802 --> 01:43:55,870
He's gone.

1153
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,373
Where'd he go?

1154
01:43:57,406 --> 01:44:00,309
The boys took him back
to where he belongs.

1155
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:14,889
Hi. This is Armando Reyes
from Alpine Lake.

1156
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,527
Yeah.

1157
01:44:18,561 --> 01:44:20,062
Good, good. Yeah.

1158
01:44:20,096 --> 01:44:22,298
I know it's-it's been a minute.

1159
01:44:23,432 --> 01:44:26,369
The reason why I'm calling is

1160
01:44:26,402 --> 01:44:29,004
I have some news about Calvin.

1161
01:44:30,373 --> 01:44:31,973
Yes.

1162
01:44:33,975 --> 01:44:36,911
Yeah, we finally found him.

1163
01:44:46,455 --> 01:44:48,257
What?

1164
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:51,294
You can't hear that?

1165
01:44:52,595 --> 01:44:54,563
-Uh-uh.
-The phone is ringing.

1166
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:00,969
Must be for you, then.

1167
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:23,592
Hello?

1168
01:45:23,626 --> 01:45:25,528
Hi, sweetie.

1169
01:45:30,299 --> 01:45:33,336
-Mom?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, baby.

1170
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:36,138
I don't have much time,
but it's me.

1171
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:42,478
Where are you?

1172
01:45:42,511 --> 01:45:44,347
You know where.

1173
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,148
It's beautiful here.

1174
01:45:48,484 --> 01:45:50,952
-It is?
-Mm.

1175
01:45:50,985 --> 01:45:53,255
Yeah, so beautiful.

1176
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:55,990
Just like you.

1177
01:45:59,994 --> 01:46:02,897
I... I miss you, Mom.

1178
01:46:02,931 --> 01:46:06,135
Oh. I miss you, too, sweetie.

1179
01:46:07,536 --> 01:46:09,505
But you did so well.

1180
01:46:09,538 --> 01:46:11,873
You saved those boys.

1181
01:46:14,009 --> 01:46:17,046
-I didn't save anyone.
-Yes, you did.

1182
01:46:17,946 --> 01:46:19,248
You set them free.

1183
01:46:19,281 --> 01:46:21,484
They're here
where they belong now.

1184
01:46:22,551 --> 01:46:24,453
Wait.

1185
01:46:24,487 --> 01:46:26,422
I have to ask you something.

1186
01:46:27,623 --> 01:46:30,025
Ask me anything.

1187
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:38,434
Will I always be this cursed?

1188
01:46:40,202 --> 01:46:41,437
Oh.

1189
01:46:42,971 --> 01:46:45,174
It's not a curse, baby.

1190
01:46:46,509 --> 01:46:48,910
It was never a curse.

1191
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:54,016
I have to go.

1192
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:58,287
Tell your brother I love him

1193
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,424
and that Robin says hi.

1194
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:10,326
Kids!

1195
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,561
Time to go.

1196
01:48:12,595 --> 01:48:14,296
Get a move on.

1197
01:48:25,307 --> 01:48:28,077
So, what do you think
of that Ernesto boy?

1198
01:48:29,278 --> 01:48:31,514
She could do a lot worse.

1199
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:33,649
-How about you?
-No, Dad...

1200
01:48:33,682 --> 01:48:35,584
That Mustang girl
seemed pretty cute to me.

1201
01:48:35,618 --> 01:48:39,054
Ah. Dad, please just...
just drive.

1202
01:48:40,122 --> 01:48:42,258
Just saying.

1203
01:48:42,291 --> 01:48:44,193
Eyes on the road.

1204
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:46,529
All right, I'm just saying.
