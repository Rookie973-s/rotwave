1
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,380
I'm not angry.

2
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm not asking for special treatment.
I'm just angry.

3
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,260
You said I was one of your best guys.

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Was.

5
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,140
But if you can't hire me back, just ask
them to take me off the blacklist.

6
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,340
Say that again, and I'll kick you and
your kid out on your ass.

7
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,300
Bringing her here to guilt me.

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,540
Look, I need to work.

9
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,480
She said her fever for the last weekend.

10
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,710
That ain't on me.

11
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,350
I'm not the jerk that spoke to a union
rep about radiation exposure one time.

12
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,570
You got your daughter.

13
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,530
Your nuts didn't fry.

14
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,430
Take the win.

15
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,410
Bye -bye.

16
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,230
Sick kid in my office.

17
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,650
You know, I didn't bring her here to
kill you.

18
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:32,810
And this is you not angry?

19
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,598
Thank you.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,860
Are you man enough to risk it all?

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,340
Today is your last chance of the year to
be on The Running Man.

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,840
If you can duck the boys in black, the
public, and McCone's hunters for 30

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,260
you'll run away with a billion new
dollars.

24
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Go on.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,600
I'll give you a head start.

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,920
That's easy, Tim, motherfuckers.

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,200
If you've got the cash, if you've got
the balls, don't miss the final run of

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
season.

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Don't worry.

30
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,539
Daddy's not that crazy.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,080
To feed the wheel, we're a big -boned
badass that bravely would bag a big box.

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Am I right, bud?

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,180
And away we'll go.

34
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,720
But for 100 new dollars, the capital of
France is A.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,080
Marseille, B. Lyon, or C. Paris.

36
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,860
Paris! C!

37
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,660
Collect!

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Cynthia,

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,460
drop a hundo in the hammy.

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,400
Oh, look at the fuzzy hamster.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,760
Did you see the fuzzy hamster? No.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,300
Next question. For 1 ,000 new dollars,
how many laboratories does a net air

43
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,800
flying V luxury jetliner have?

44
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,300
Is it A4, B5, or C6?

45
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,380
It's A, B, bud.

46
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,660
It's A.

47
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,190
She said, since 12 o 'clock, the rich
are even more full of shit than they

48
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,410
thought. But

49
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,130
in

50
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:47,910
my hand is the question that contains
your life.

51
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,290
Who invented the Babylonian?

52
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,430
But we hardly knew yet.

53
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,020
Okay. How's she doing? Mommy.

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,300
How's she doing?

55
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,180
She's really burning up. Hey. Good
night, Mommy.

56
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
I need to guide you here.

57
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Can I help?

58
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,820
She's hurting bad.

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
That's not good.

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Two drops.

61
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
All right.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Wait, what is this?

63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Look, I know.

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,820
Molly said he would have real farms,
damn it. Real flumets. Yeah, well, a

65
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,339
black market buddy has all the stuff to
kill people, but it's sold out on the

66
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,339
things to save them.

67
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
All right.

68
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,100
This stuff doesn't make her better,
babe. But it makes her feel better.

69
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,340
Look, I just pulled another double at
the Hellhole Club, and if it wasn't dead

70
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,740
in the morning, I'd still be there. So,
that's what we can afford today.

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,540
I talked to him.

72
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
What, you did?

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,100
Who punched Kathy?

74
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Took her with me.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,020
I didn't, you know, kill Trip. No, I
mean, Trip wouldn't beat the crap out of

76
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
him.

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,040
Smart. I left my pride at the door. I
was respectful.

78
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,080
Maybe got a little heated at the end,
but by then it was game over.

79
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,240
They don't want us to win.

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
I'm sorry, Adley.

81
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,660
I tried.

82
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,740
Hey, you're just being punished for
being a good man.

83
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,240
You were just standing up for your guys.

84
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,900
It's just the same thing, right? You
know, I got to be a dad and they didn't.

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,420
Ben, none of this is your fault.

86
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,860
It doesn't change our situation.

87
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
No.

88
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,060
We're in it together, right?

89
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Wait, where's your son?

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,880
Oh, Ben, those take forever to make. No,
no, it was on when we got home. Hold

91
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,160
on. It's here. It's here. Those are her
comfies, babe.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Shh.

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,440
When did you kick that off?

94
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
Shh. Don't worry.

95
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Dadda's gonna find it.

96
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,720
Get it together, girl.

97
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,780
Honey, are you going back to the
Libertine? I don't want to. I thought

98
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,380
that place was dead in the morning. It
is.

99
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,640
Except for the most desperate wasted
loser.

100
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,220
My friend told me how to get tips out of
these guys.

101
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,980
The other waitresses do it all the time.
No. Look, if these jerks can flash 50

102
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,900
ND per rattle, they can accidentally
save a kid's life. Babe, I can't let you

103
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,360
that. Ben, she is burning up.

104
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,460
Look, my friend makes 20 new every
fifth. Usually it's just one customer.

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
Hey, now, you know I never do that.

106
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,420
My friend doesn't even let him grab her
ass.

107
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,950
She just charms them into tipping for
something that's not on sale. And right

108
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,370
now it's prime time for that kind of
play. No, it's the wrong exec.

109
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,790
Thinks that you ripped him off. You
could end up in the dump like that girl

110
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,330
across the street. I'm sorry. These men
are savages. If we don't get real farms

111
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,510
from a real doc, she won't survive
another night.

112
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,430
We don't have a choice.

113
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,530
Yeah, we do.

114
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,010
Where are you going?

115
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,210
Get money.

116
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,150
Enough for her to see a real doc before
bedtime.

117
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,890
You actually mean about taking chances?

118
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,070
People on that show never come back. I'm
not trying out for the running man.

119
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,010
There's a ton of other shows. Look, the
lowest amount someone won today, $75 new

120
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,170
dollars. I get on one of those, we get
the meds. Oh, no. People on these games

121
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,650
get hurt, Tim, like, really bad.

122
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,210
Kid stuff makes the kind of jobs that
work.

123
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,910
Hey.

124
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,950
Promise me you won't go on that show.

125
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,590
I promise.

126
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Hope you enjoy it.

127
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,630
Even if you're never ready to get up
there.

128
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,970
Network building.

129
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,330
Tryouts.

130
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,370
Thank you.

131
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
He's going to try out.

132
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,880
Hey, this guy's in trouble. Shut up and
get back to the line. This guy needs

133
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,980
help. No helping. Step back. Get him a
fucking doctor and I will. I said step

134
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
back now.

135
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,420
Keep moving, people.

136
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,900
Nothing to see.

137
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Back to the line.

138
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240

Tim. Jampy.

Jampy's my last name, and Tim is short
for Timothy.

155

Got it.

156
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,090
Should we all go around and say our
names in a fun fact?

157
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,610
We can do it later.

158
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,690
What's that?

159
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,470

Thanks.

162
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,210
You didn't have to do that.

163
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,450
No problem.

164
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,730
You'll help him, Will.

165
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,870
Obedient. Never.

166
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,130
Heroism. Useless.

167
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,470
Technology.

168
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,370
Abuse. Freedom.

169
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,810
Nope.

170
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,610
Authority. Burn.

171
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,480
Anarchy. When?

172
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Just it.

173
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Hilarious.

174
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Family.

175
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,780
Everything.

176
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,760
Next image. What do you see?

177
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,000
Cutest puppy ever.

178
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,940
What about this one?

179
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,480
Oh, it's my favorite flower.

180
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,120
Giving me a hug.

181
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,620
Final image. Tell me about it.

182
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Infinite bunny.

183
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,810
Can you suck into a nice tornado, spring
blood all over the galaxy?

184
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,630
Mr. Richards, you are quantifiably the
angriest man to ever audition for our

185
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,630
show.

186
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,870
Well, that really pisses me off.

187
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,910
Proceed directly to your next
destination.

188
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,050
Final assessment.

189
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,890
Ooh, our jumpsuits are in here.

190
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,330
You're required.

191
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,560
To change into your size jumpsuit.
You're on the fuck out.

192
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,860
Bang, bang. Nice.

193
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,220
You must wear your designated jumpsuit.

194
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,540
Yo, you got a target on your back.

195
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Yo, Richard.

196
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,640
Knew it would be us, man.

197
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,280
Knew it would be us.

198
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,460
Come on, shit happens, right?

199
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Ooh,

200
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,380
that's us.

201
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,930
They say you run to add life to your
day.

202
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,870
Not days to your life.

203
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,030
That's it, both are pretty fucking true.

204
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,330
Don't miss the final run of the season.

205
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,130
I always thought this was fake, but... I
don't know.

206
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,230
Feeling pretty real now.

207
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,150
Right, guys?

208
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,690
Feeling really -osa.

209
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
second, y 'all.

210
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Later.

211
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Miss Laughlin?

212
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,640
Hey, uh, you're the man, Richards.

213
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,380
Never would have made it without you.

214
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,560
You like spaghetti?

215
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,980
Hey, so far, so good.

216
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,750
Don't worry, we'll keep it down.

217
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,170
Mr.

218
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,490
Richard?

219
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,589
Eat a non -aspericulum.

220
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,770
There's not death that man should fear.

221
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,650
You're never beginning to live.

222
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,089
Dan Killian.

223
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,609
Go ahead.

224
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,650
Relax.

225
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,700
No, critics say The Running Man
represents a return to the barbarism of

226
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,820
Roman Colosseum.

227
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,340
I disagree.

228
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm not doing The Running Man.

229
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,060
I'm aware of your family crisis.

230
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,960
And I think the contents of this
envelope will help.

231
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,740
If we come to an agreement, it's yours
to keep.

232
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,540
Call it a signing bonus.

233
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,500
I'll do any other show.

234
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,130
The most anyone's ever won on another
show is a thousand ND, and I know it

235
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,310
sounds like a tremendous sum, but it's
not enough to get your family out of

236
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,310
slumside for good.

237
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,510
Whereas on The Running Man, merely
surviving a single week would put the

238
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,230
Richards in the top 1 % of global
wealth.

239
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,230
See for yourself.

240
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,570
Page 66.

241
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,090
I'm not trying to get myself killed.

242
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,970
Mr. Richards, I'll be honest with you.

243
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,140
I've said this to every contestant, but
this is the first time I've really meant

244
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,140
it.

245
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,340
You have what it takes to win this game.

246
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,580
Our viewers have a burning desire to see
a runner go the distance, and we've had

247
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,280
men come close, 29 days in season one.

248
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,560
But it's going to take somebody special
to go the full 30.

249
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,740
You tested off the charts, so I looked
through your employment history and had

250
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,240
my assistant shoot me your highlights.

251
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,700
Now this is the most thrilling 10
seconds of video I've seen all year.

252
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,780
Well, they fired me for destroying the
harness.

253
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,420
But you bounced back.

254
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,020
Hired by DefenseNet, the best wages
downtown.

255
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,200
No best dog shit, still dog shit.

256
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,280
Then why beg to be rehired?

257
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Let's be honest.

258
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,440
You stuck your neck out one too many
times for your coworkers and got your

259
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
chopped off.

260
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,800
Pretty gutsy, considering half the
country thinks union should be illegal.

261
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I come from the other half.

262
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,720
So you can dismiss twice.

263
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,940
Right there is why you can win this
game.

264
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,400
You're a fighter, Richards.

265
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,400
Network blacklisted you from all the
corps they own, except for this one.

266
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,440
You risked your life for other men and
their families long enough. Now do it

267
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
you and yours.

268
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,320
Put your boots on.

269
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,540
Make them pay in cash.

270
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,320
Sign the agreement and change your
family's life forever.

271
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,340
What father wouldn't want that?

272
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,140
Then your thumbprint.

273
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,780
Press the box.

274
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,700
Welcome to the running man.

275
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
This is exciting.

276
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
Ah, there you are.

277
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,180
I assume you two had an understanding
based on her line of work?

278
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,180
He's a waitress at a club.

279
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,820
I've got a nerve.

280
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,460
My apologies.

281
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,920
To mutually profitable collaboration.

282
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,300
I'm Agent Duck.

283
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:57,750
your family alliance liaison family
alliance is the network's premium

284
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:03,290
security service it's included in your
contract no point winning all that jack

285
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,450
just to get your people robbed and
killed we'll relocate the fam put them

286
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:16,270
an assumed name that's the one thing you
won't have to worry about you

287
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:22,390
have one call to the wife let her know
we'll be there in the morning I need to

288
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,790
bring her this tonight. I promise I will
be back before the show starts. No one

289
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,790
comes back.

290
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,970
I got a lock you in a really nice
apartment.

291
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,370
Come on, man.

292
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,390
I had a sick kid.

293
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,450
I'll deliver it now and bring back her,
I see.

294
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,250
Can you give her this, too?

295
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,450
You okay?

296
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,950
Where are you?

297
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,430
I'm at the network building. I'm fine.

298
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,430
Look, a man named Doug, he's gonna bring
you 500 new in cash.

299
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,160
Take her to Uptown Mercy, all right?

300
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,540
It's 24 -7. Get her a real doc, whatever
she needs.

301
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Hey, Matt.

302
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
What did you do?

303
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,780
I'm on the running, man.

304
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,740
Listen to me.

305
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,400
I promise I'll be back.

306
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,300
I told you to never, ever wear my shoes.

307
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,580
Ever. Your feet smell like dead mice.
Now I have to bring them. You're an

308
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,400
person. What is going on here?

309
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,420
Mom, she stole my shoes.

310
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,140
Because Alyssa put them in my shoe
cubby. Take off my shoes.

311
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,780
Are you serious?

312
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,380
to starting gun fires tonight at 8.

313
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
Showtime.

314
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Let's roll.

315
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Rest.

316
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,840
As you're running back, you're going to
use it for timers, reminders, and

317
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
rewards.

318
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,800
Good luck on that.

319
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:25,180
You got one job out there say what's on
your mind

320
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,160
you're feeling angry and violent to
grieve don't think before you speak

321
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,180
for pussies go off curse shake your dick
at the crowd. It's all good free me

322
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
Bobby T

323
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,880
Daniel, you son of a bitch. How many
times I gotta tell you, do not put blue

324
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
in my amuse -bouche.

325
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,360
When I pull a mercury poisoning on a
show night, your bouche will not be

326
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,260
Dan. Oh, is this the one?

327
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Yep.

328
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Oh.

329
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,760
I know it's weird to see me in real
life, but you're used to it.

330
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,820
I'm flesh and blood just like you are.

331
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,400
My robot puts my pants on one leg at a
time.

332
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Classic Bobby.

333
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Not.

334
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,710
Shake your dick at the crowd. That's a
bad note.

335
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,589
Let's wait.

336
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,930
20 seconds, people.

337
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,310
All right. See you out there.

338
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:20,610
There it is.

339
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,010
The new Coliseum.

340
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,550
America.

341
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,880
The greatest country in the fucking
universe. We work hard. And after a long

342
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,540
of busting ass, we get to kick back and
feel good.

343
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,200
But some don't want to work for that
privilege.

344
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,680
These fraudsters, freeloaders.

345
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,300
And why should they when they can take
it from you?

346
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,040
Welcome to the game where we give three
of these tough guys all the freedom they

347
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
want.

348
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,380
Biodata Curates.

349
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,540
No standards, no trackers. For 30 days,
all that stands between these men and

350
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,060
millions is you.

351
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,500
Record, record, reward.

352
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,240
With over 10 million new dollars in
prizes won, the best audience in the

353
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,640
remains undefeated.

354
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,720
It's the running...

355
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,480
Your fury at the injustice of the world
has stopped you from reaching your full

356
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,760
potential, but now that anger is your
superpower.

357
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,000
Embrace it. Our program hails from right
here in Co -op City.

358
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,500
Ben Richards, a healthy...

359
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,850
35 -year -old man who thinks he's too
good to work for a living.

360
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,450
Mr. Rizzo's last job was a full -time
position at DefenseNet until he spilled

361
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,890
military secrets to Commie Union he's
not even in.

362
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,970
That's bullshit!

363
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,390
That's bullshit!

364
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,950
Come on, show this kid. Chill out.

365
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,349
That's right!

366
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,790
He bit the hand that feeds him because
that's what dogs do.

367
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,250
Remember that face?

368
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,870
You win 3 ,000 new dollars.

369
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,820
Ten thousand. It leads to a kill.

370
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,540
We double the prizes for the last one of
the season. Because when the stakes go

371
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,380
up. The stakes go down. And the stakes
beat high.

372
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,660
Because the thousands he wins.

373
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,280
Goes to his wife Sheila.

374
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,600
A night witch.

375
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,220
Who only takes the biggest tips. At the
liberty.

376
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,020
If you compare them. By any window.

377
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:09,110
Richard, it's up to her now to raise the
tragic kin of their sin.

378
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,649
What's that?

379
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:16,790
I think it's time for... Well, Mr.
Richards.

380
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,930
Come on, can we hear it?

381
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,690
Do you have any famous last words?

382
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,150
Yeah.

383
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,530
Fuck you, Dan!

384
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,630
Mr. Richards is what they used to refer
to as a game changer.

385
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,710
Now listen, I shouldn't say this, but
when the run begins, lay low with your

386
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,970
kind. You'll last longer.

387
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,030
And also, in case you missed it in your
contract, every goon you kill wins you a

388
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,030
10K bonus.

389
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,830
And it's a hundo per hunter.

390
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,730
I don't know how you... But I'm gonna
fuck you up someday.

391
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,170
That's the spirit.

392
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,650
Runners get a $1 ,000 new dollar advance
and a 12 -hour running start.

393
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,610
The hunters don't hunt until the record
and report app goes live.

394
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,910
Tomorrow morning. Roll to the running
game. You must take 10 minutes of on

395
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,749
ham per day.

396
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,330
These envelopes cannot be tracked.

397
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:39,270
Drop them in a network drone express
mailbox before midnight or you'll be

398
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,550
disqualified. Thank you. From further
winnings, but still hunted for 30 days.

399
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,110
Don't die for free.

400
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,530
Get your takes in. Roll free.

401
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,030
Run far.

402
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,109
Get rich.

403
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,330
Make it to midnight tomorrow and win 5
,000 new dollars. Awards increase by 1

404
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,870
,000 per day and double at the end of
each week. The grand prize for surviving

405
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,990
day 30 is now a billion new dollars.

406
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,510
They may be amongst you right now!

407
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:33,250
And on the left, the ghost haunting
every runner's dreams, Chief McCall!

408
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,830
Search and destroy, gentlemen.

409
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,970
Let him go!

410
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,150
Take a last look at these thugs.

411
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,210
Observe the typical disguises their kind
use to escape justice.

412
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,890
In mere moments, they will walk among
you.

413
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,020
whatever they want until we stop them
together.

414
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,520
13th at Obama. Hey, Running Man!

415
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,820
I was watching you on the freebie. 13th
at Obama.

416
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,700
Okay.

417
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,900
What's up, man?

418
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,920
Hey, take a pic with me. Okay.

419
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,370
What do you mean? No, it's okay.

420
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,750
You got to be nice, man, so people don't
report you.

421
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,210
People will do that. Not me, though,
man. I'm a nice guy. You know what?

422
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,810
right. Hey, we should pull over and pick
up one of these hookers. She can take

423
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,810
the pick, huh?

424
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,590
Sickest idea ever, man.

425
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,639
What? You don't see me on the hatch?

426
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,699
I saw you two blocks away on the
infrared.

427
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
What do you want?

428
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,320
Look, I need two ID cards and a gun.

429
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,460
Forget it. I don't do guns.

430
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,179
Go see Mickey on the third.

431
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,020
What in the hell is the problem?

432
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,960
The running man?

433
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,060
What were you thinking?

434
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,960
I had you pegged for smart. Look, I
didn't have a choice. Kathy was... Do

435
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,639
know how much danger you put me in
coming here?

436
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,050
If you want to kill yourself, fine, but
leave me out of it. Okay?

437
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,270
You got it?

438
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,590
God damn it, Ben.

439
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,430
IDs are 100.

440
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,850
It's 30 each for costumes and
accessories. I've got a priest, I've got

441
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:22,170
veteran, I've got an exec. And the rush
order makes it 200 new, all in.

442
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,870
Go hide out in survival.

443
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,370
It's aisle five.

444
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,350
I'm going to lock the incinerator. Oh, I
already did.

445
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,110
You don't mind if I check, do you?

446
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:45,770
Listen to him. If he lets go, we're all

447
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,750
dead. Is that a lot of these?

448
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,630
No, I can't keep them in stock.

449
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,570
Those TVs?

450
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,310
don't watch your back come on

451
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:01,690
so it's gonna work

452
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:07,210
absolutely okay you ready one two three

453
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:13,370
all right let's uh test out those
contacts

454
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:20,130
okay can you read anything on that shelf

455
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,920
E -F -E -20. Holy shit. How do you have
black Irish?

456
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,140
That's not for sale. Yeah, like I put
that shit in my pocket.

457
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,360
Only took a couple grams to blow up fat
birds in the sewers uptown.

458
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
E -F -E.

459
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,460
Big fucking explosion.

460
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,000
So, what's the plan?

461
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
I don't know.

462
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,340
Play low with my own kind?

463
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,340
Your own kind will sell you out in a
heartbeat.

464
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,800
I find the busiest place you can.

465
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,710
Just appear in the crowd. That's my
advice.

466
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,890
Well, you can leave the thing where you
came.

467
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,270
Molly, I had to do it.

468
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,290
No, you didn't.

469
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,670
I was going to bring you on here.

470
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,970
Sort of as a partner. I should have told
Sheila yesterday.

471
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,850
But I wanted to tell you myself.

472
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,030
Hey, too late for that now.

473
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,490
Well, Godspeed.

474
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,210
See you on the big screen.

475
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,900
New York City, one way.

476
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,620
They've traveled,

477
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,680
Mr. Springer.

478
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,550
He nicked your face.

479
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:02,070
Did you ever saw it? You say anything, I
will kill you so fast your mom won't

480
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,070
even wake up. But your mustache.

481
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,470
So sorry about that.

482
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,930
I'm going to snap back.

483
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,770
Now arriving at the offense station,
this is the final stop on this train.

484
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,390
Welcome to the Brandt Hotel, Mr.
Springer.

485
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,530
You shaved your mustache.

486
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,850
Fell off on the train.

487
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,130
I hate when that happens.

488
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,030
Everything okay, Mr. Springer?

489
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,730
Yeah.

490
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,990
Just, uh... Have a good night.

491
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,030
Day. You know what?

492
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,830
Apple.

493
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:33,700
say i have to be on camera 10 minutes a
day they didn't say which part so

494
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,280
guess you can watch my ass take a nap

495
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
One down.

496
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Rewind.

497
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,420
Live update!

498
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Let's go!

499
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,900
See,

500
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,720
watch the running, man.

501
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,178
I guess.

502
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,540
I heard there's this guy on there who
kind of looks like me and he's really

503
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,060
or something. I don't know.

504
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,640
I don't know.

505
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,920
I'm going to come back in a little bit
and I'm going to try to ask you that

506
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
again.

507
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,840
And that's Jansky stepping out with
his... The fuse

508
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,580
and bullet.

509
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,360
It's just a matter of time.

510
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Get out of there, buddy.

511
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Better eat up, Tim.

512
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,400
Enjoy those last bites before it's last
rites. Move, move. You're walking. It's

513
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
the fucking running man.

514
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Here we go.

515
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,900
Oh, man.

516
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Hi,

517
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,760
I'd like to extend my stay for three
days.

518
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,250
I'd be happy to arrange that for you,
Mr. Springer.

519
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,630
In the same room, if possible.

520
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,030
Let me see what I can do.

521
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,350
Thank you.

522
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,210
You're in luck.

523
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,070
Looks like I can keep you in the same
room, Mr. Springer.

524
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:41,330
Great.

525
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,130
Can I get you a car this morning?

526
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,750
Uh, you know what?

527
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:47,970
I have to go walk.

528
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,660
Hey,

529
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,380
brother, I need to get off the street.

530
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,980
Oh, yeah?

531
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,200
Looking for a place to rag out for the
month.

532
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
Mm -hmm.

533
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,140
Or the net, if you know what I mean.

534
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,680
Oh, is that so?

535
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,580
I'll give you $100 for your room and
another $100 for your jacket.

536
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,520
A deuce hundo for this rat -ass jacket
and that rat -ass room?

537
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,460
Well, you need to get a Jamaica plane,
pick up your head, man. Come on.

538
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,530
Put that shit away, wouldn't you mind?
Let us kill him.

539
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,130
Let me see your face.

540
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,570
Where'd you deploy?

541
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,030
Alaska.

542
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,530
Hey, Shrapnel. You ain't seen combat,
but I reckon it ain't stolen valor if

543
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,530
paid me for it.

544
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:44,810
Thanks.

545
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,280
Hey, you listen to me. You stay out of
my stash.

546
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,140
I catch you in that basement again, I'm
going to stop you. And I'm going to get

547
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,780
Big Bird to take care of you. He'll kick
your cow ass over the moon. Beat it.

548
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,980
Good luck with that.

549
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,600
You know, I've always been the guy who
fought first.

550
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,620
I showed up to work first, I left last.

551
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,620
Hasn't done much for me, obviously.

552
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,940
I mean, I'm on the murder show.

553
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
What are you going to do?

554
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,820
Take on the whole world?

555
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,000
Sweet. So here I am, a grown -ass man
playing hide -and -seek for money.

556
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,410
Keep it cool.

557
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:36,990
Try not to burn out.

558
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,430
Depraved. Demonic.

559
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,210
Deceased.

560
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,710
What's happening for the remaining
winner's week?

561
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,870
Tune in and find out.

562
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,290
Next up, rich and bold, it's those
Americanos.

563
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,190
Hey, Jim.

564
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,090
How do you like this energy wine?

565
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,210
I'm a big fan.

566
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:01,368
Love it.

567
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,490
How about you, Bill?

568
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,660
That's pretty much my favorite thing,
Jim.

569
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,480
So, uh, guys, you mind if I ask you a
personal question?

570
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,220
Why do we all have the same voice?

571
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,820
Relax, Ben.

572
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,640
We'll know later.

573
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,580
Good to see you too, Frank.

574
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:39,830
You better rest Frank.

575
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,470
At least you got someone to talk to.

576
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,820
We're dead, Frank.

577
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,500
There's no way out.

578
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Never.

579
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:42,050
I don't believe they've located the room
this mother's hiding in.

580
00:52:02,779 --> 00:52:05,900
Walk the walk.

581
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,590
Down there.

582
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:27,830
What's this?

583
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,050
McComb's giving the signal.

584
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,510
The rover can't.

585
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,670
This is why we play the game running
fans.

586
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,990
The moment of truth.

587
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:46,010
Where these animals find out we're in a
society of rules.

588
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:52,470
And there they are.

589
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,390
The hunters posted on our side of the
juice room. We're going in.

590
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,630
Here we go.

591
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,590
Not going anywhere.

592
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:14,630
Bravo.

593
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:30,190
Hey, buddy.

594
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:33,890
Get out pretty deep. The hunters are
racing to intercept their prey.

595
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,210
Run, Mr. Richards!

596
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,950
This is what we want, running man!

597
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,350
Let's go, go!

598
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:50,310
Stop filming me!

599
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:52,830
No, he's out.

600
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,430
He's headed for the lot.

601
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,730
Let me stop.

602
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,690
Richards, you're going down.

603
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,308
I'm still here.

604
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,310
Just kidding.

605
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,270
Everyone's looking for you.

606
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,060
Ayo, stay here. I'll be right back.

607
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,340
I got you, Regis.

608
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,310
Don't run around and survive the love
update. How the hell are you?

609
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:46,950
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

610
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:50,910
I can pay you.

611
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,810
Just get me off the street for the
night.

612
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:53,848
Hell no.

613
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:54,850
Bob and Dee. What?

614
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,210
We need street meds.

615
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,630
My sister got cancer real bad.

616
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,710
Make it 10.

617
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:03,490
Get her the good stuff.

618
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,610
Not bad.

619
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,190
I love the price of you.

620
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,940
How fast can you move on, Richard?

621
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,440
Faster every day.

622
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:20,860
Just a shocking amount of destruction
here. The NCG on tactical alert as units

623
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:25,140
pour in from neighboring districts,
seeking justice for their fallen

624
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,600
The NCG bomb squad is on scene combing
through the rubble for evidence.

625
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,860
Preliminary reports indicate Richard set
off the explosion in the basement.

626
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,240
His body is yet to be found.

627
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,980
Baby.

628
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,260
You can set your grandkids up for life
with a home recording report.

629
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,480
Do you think the network would rather
pay us reward money or make up some

630
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,600
bullshit and arrest us?

631
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,560
What if I gave you enough to get your
sister real forms?

632
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Say 500 new.

633
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,260
I can get you out of varsity, but it
won't be for money.

634
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,560
Bro, this dude ain't going nowhere.

635
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,500
Goons got the hoots around it. We out.

636
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,740
Stop.

637
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,040
Just a little pinch and you can't feel
good, bro.

638
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
Richard's letter.

639
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,160
Find out tomorrow night. I'm a running
man, baby.

640
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,640
You know, you seem like a smart cat.

641
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,320
What made you sign up to be a cog in
that propaganda machine?

642
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,260
I'm just trying to take care of my
family.

643
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,440
Just like you and your sister.

644
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,860
Jim.

645
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,260
My kid was sick.

646
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,860
I sent my wife enough to get her well.

647
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,380
Now I'm trying to win enough to get them
out.

648
00:59:53,529 --> 00:59:54,529
She's only two.

649
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:58,170
So if I do my job, she'll never even
remember Slumside.

650
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,210
Okay, Richards.

651
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,570
I can get you past that blockade.

652
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:07,170
But I'm gonna need a couple days to set
it up, so hide out here in the meantime.

653
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,970
You know, you could go to full 30 if you
play smart.

654
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,250
And what makes you such an expert?

655
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,090
Tune in and find out.

656
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:19,810
Until the cold day.

657
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,200
I don't want a lot, I want just enough.

658
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,660
So why is it got to be so damn tough?

659
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:36,240
What goes on behind the scenes of the
biggest freebie show of all time?

660
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,660
to The Apostle, episode 30, The Real
Rules of the Running Man. It's your day

661
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,940
do and distribute.

662
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,640
The network has three types for every
run. Oh my God.

663
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,200
Type 1, hopeless dude.

664
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:56,620
Hopeless dude is cursed with a fatal
misunderstanding of human nature. Tim?

665
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,840
Yeah? He usually lasts less than 48
hours.

666
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,960
Come and get me.

667
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,640
Dinner's served, pal.

668
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,040
Oh, damn.

669
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:10,340
Oh, he is cooked.

670
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,580
Type 2. Negative dude.

671
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,860
Negative dude knows he ain't got a
chance in hell. He just wants to go out

672
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,080
a bang or two. Make life greater.

673
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,120
Leave a fucking crater.

674
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,060
Bro gets smoked by the end of week one
because he buys too much ass and not

675
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,820
enough food with his running start.

676
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:31,940
Slave to his appetite, he often serves
himself up on a plate. Ha!

677
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,480
Suck this in hell!

678
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,180
Boom!

679
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,640
Run it out!

680
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,260
Type three.

681
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,560
Oh, yeah!

682
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:46,670
Final dude. Final dude. has a fierce
will to survive yet he never wins the

683
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:52,590
network they can't find anyone any time
but if a runner's getting good ratings

684
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:59,150
they let him run 13 days and just like
papa always said you can cry but you

685
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:05,190
can't catch a ghost so by the end of
week two radios usually peak oh shit the

686
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:10,570
crowd wants blood and final dude becomes
a victim they might hide from

687
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:30,350
is that supposed to inspire me oh come
on man don't you get it after that

688
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:36,690
tonight live prime time you you are
final dude

689
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:41,230
and they're gonna squeeze every last
drop of ratings out of your ass so you

690
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:45,750
at least until Negative Dude flames out
to get somewhere safe, which gives us

691
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:50,190
enough time to set you up for the
biggest underdog win in game show

692
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,390
So where the hell is safe?

693
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:54,570
I'm working on it.

694
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:02,090
Hey, Penbell.

695
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,470
It's been a while.

696
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,970
So you know what you're doing?

697
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:08,070
Guess we'll find out. Got a package
headed your way.

698
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,890
Yeah, special delivery, as seen on
preview.

699
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,540
Okay, I see you.

700
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,560
And pick up location B. Right.

701
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,380
Mama's coming, baby.

702
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:24,540
Okay, okay.

703
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,840
So how does a five

704
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,840
-year -old get lung cancer?

705
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,120
Radioactive dust.

706
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,380
From the Rhode Island explosion.

707
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,860
Never heard about that.

708
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,880
Yeah, you never heard of it because the
network owns the news.

709
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:54,880
Just like they own that munitions
factory. Just like they own the

710
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,640
why bother complying with safety regs,
right?

711
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,840
That's how Joan got sick.

712
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,680
For all you watching, not the execs.

713
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,540
Not the technicos.

714
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,930
You live in a tower uptown. I'm not
talking to you.

715
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,070
I'm talking to the people in the co -op.

716
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,030
The ones who can't get a job. The
squatter tribe.

717
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:19,770
The kids are getting shot for looking at
a goo in the wrong way.

718
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,770
There's something you all need to know.

719
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:27,090
The network is giving our kids cancer
and they are covering it up.

720
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:29,190
Previously on The Running Man.

721
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:31,130
I'm still here.

722
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,910
Just sit, eaters.

723
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,510
Uh -oh.

724
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,720
Not the execs. Not the technicals. If
you live in a tower of town, I'm not

725
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,820
talking to you. I'm talking to the
people in the car.

726
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,260
The squatter tribe.

727
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,000
The ones who can't get a job.

728
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:19,000
The kids getting shot for looking at a
goon the wrong way. There's something

729
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
all need to know.

730
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:25,900
I laughed my ass off smoking those
goons. And I wasn't just laughing at the

731
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,200
screams. I was laughing at their kids.

732
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,960
Now you know how it felt when daddy did
it to someone else.

733
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,920
I didn't say that. Okay, I made a video
about the network giving kids cancer.

734
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:38,060
It's all fake.

735
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,240
Son, you gotta get him out of here.

736
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,040
Tonight. Right now. I want him gone.
Bring him home.

737
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,100
What kind of world are we living in?

738
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:51,880
Running fans, I just heard from producer
Dan Kelly, who has personally doubled

739
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,000
the reward for Ben Richards.

740
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,880
Now, $20 ,000 is deducted for any
concerns or corporate reports that lead

741
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,040
stab. Mark, Mark.

742
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:05,290
Well, it's getting crazy on you. Yeah,
the game's around tonight.

743
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,610
Yeah, we gotta roll. You ready?

744
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,230
Go.

745
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,170
Okay. Keep your eye on those.

746
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,730
Those biker boys are on the valley. I'm
going to reward them. Got it.

747
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,150
Look, they're following us. I know, I
know. Stay cool.

748
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,550
Come on.

749
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:33,630
Yo what's going on?

750
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,760
My pen pal needs a day to prep transport
to a shelter.

751
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,680
You can trust him with your life.

752
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,740
Just don't mention hot dogs around the
man.

753
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,919
Say hot dog?

754
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,040
Yep. Go catch that flow train to Maine.

755
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,460
Less people in the sticks, but keep your
head down and don't trust anyone.

756
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,400
This guy.

757
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,640
Name's Elton. Hardcore.

758
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,860
Down for the course.

759
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,779
You really think this will work?

760
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,660
Look, we know they track denominators.

761
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,510
And pre -shoot the rest of your self
-tapes. My man heads out, drives them on

762
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,550
the way. Why are you safe underground?

763
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:26,890
They won't know what hit them.

764
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:28,810
Out.

765
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:29,910
That's what you got.

766
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:33,529
Just in case.

767
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,170
Why are you helping me?

768
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:40,630
You see the power they have?

769
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,790
If we don't guide each other's back,
this game's over before it even begins.

770
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,120
What's up, America?

771
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,620
I was about to tell you the network
fakes these self -tapes, but if I did,

772
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,060
they'd just fake this one too. So, I'm
just going to read you something

773
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:09,040
Dear Diary, I woke up with the blahs
today.

774
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:14,359
My regular gig of killing heroic goons
was feeling too routine.

775
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,180
Time for a me day.

776
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,540
So I ate my favorite breakfast in bed,
defenseless puppies. I could have eaten

777
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:22,540
one.

778
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:25,649
Then I did yoga and blew up a
courthouse.

779
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:26,868
I know.

780
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,890
It's a good habit.

781
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:32,970
But tonight, I'm going to go out to
another school.

782
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:36,290
And then, you know,

783
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:38,729
you know, you know what you're doing.

784
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:42,149
Mr.

785
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:47,229
Richards thinks he's funny. But what if
he was the last laugh when McComb

786
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:48,229
catches them laughing?

787
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:50,689
Mr. Richards?

788
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,530
We're still here, you shittiers!

789
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,930
Damn, Richard, that's a tough act to
follow.

790
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:06,190
Yeah!

791
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,870
Oh!

792
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,610
Go off, neighbor.

793
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:14,930
Oh, my God! Look at him fall!

794
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:16,930
Who does next?

795
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:18,470
Definitely her.

796
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:19,990
Laugh, Lincoln.

797
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,780
Real. Cheap boys going down. No way. I
got ten claims there's Ben Richards died

798
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:30,160
next. Oh, come on. He's picked the
network off all the way. That's why he's

799
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,700
gonna win. The guy's got marks. Yeah,
he's one of us.

800
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,300
Taking on the boys in black.

801
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,880
Giving the world a finger.

802
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,480
He's your final runner.

803
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,200
That's a fact. Damn straight.

804
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,480
What do you think, Reverend?

805
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,900
You seen this Richards guy?

806
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,400
No.

807
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,320
But he sounds like quite the character.

808
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:50,610
What's wrong with you?

809
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,650
He's blind, you fucking idiot.

810
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:55,790
Me again.

811
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,930
Look, here's the real deal.

812
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:00,790
I'm not out here trying to fight the
power.

813
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:02,530
I'm not out here to have fun.

814
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,890
I'm here to win and get back to my
family.

815
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:10,390
You won't see me throwing Molotov
cocktails. You won't see me throwing

816
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,210
In fact, you won't see me at all.

817
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:14,990
Just in time, father.

818
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:18,610
Best take out of Maine.

819
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:21,970
Thank you.

820
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,170
My son.

821
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:37,990
Hey, Charlie.

822
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:39,650
Can I ask you something?

823
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:41,130
Of course, my son.

824
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,790
I got this girlfriend.

825
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:44,950
Okay.

826
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:49,510
Am I going to hell for using rubbers?

827
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,860
You may well go for an obvious number.

828
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,900
I've 10 brothers and sisters.

829
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,300
My father said he was in hell every
single day.

830
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,320
Thanks, Father.

831
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,060
Have a good night.

832
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,400
Careful out there.

833
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,720
You think you're the guy who stops you
from seeing my daughter again?

834
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,080
This is a message for my fellow
citizens.

835
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,480
And let me make this clear for the cheap
seats.

836
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:23,500
If I die on this show, I died for the
two things I believe in.

837
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:29,820
My wife and my kid, everything else and
everyone else can fuck off.

838
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:41,810
We all know it. But that

839
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:47,030
sound is... We're paying Miss Laughlin a
run for her money.

840
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:52,510
She rolled the dice on a very public
appearance at the Holy Grail Casino. But

841
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,270
didn't gamble that our hundreds would be
there.

842
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,640
Looks like some red bugs.

843
01:15:07,789 --> 01:15:11,270
Sorry hunters, all you managed to kill
was my vibe.

844
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,000
Remember, kids, don't drink and drive.

845
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:15,480
Unless you're good at it.

846
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,100
That's a hot touch, kids.

847
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:27,700
Beyond the cash reward, Jeff and Gina
will receive a lifetime supply of fun

848
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,700
twink cereal.

849
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:34,420
And then...

850
01:16:08,009 --> 01:16:09,009
Come on, hurry.

851
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,450
Hunters will be out for blood.

852
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,250
They hate civilian kills.

853
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,050
Things are going to start ramping up.

854
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:23,250
Well, wouldn't be surprised if they fire
up the DNA papers tonight.

855
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,890
Oh, what a tough guy.

856
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:35,510
I'm not looking for any friends. Don't
ask for an autograph.

857
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:38,050
Alfie! What if he's in Derry?

858
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,330
He's not in Derry, Mom.

859
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:40,610
Don't worry, it's fine, Mom.

860
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:44,160
She thinks you're an actual demon, but
she's fairly deaf. We can use our normal

861
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:47,280
voices. Kill him, wealthy bastard.

862
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,840
Hand him down!

863
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,640
She used to be a kind, clever woman.

864
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:54,280
This is where it all happens.

865
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,860
Amateur lab for making handcrafted soap,
far as you know.

866
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:03,240
Normal, non -revolutionary literature.

867
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,800
Wink, wink.

868
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,880
Copier for my harmless community
newsletter.

869
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:10,740
You follow my drift?

870
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,100
Uh -huh.

871
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,520
So what's a DNA sever?

872
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:22,640
A black -off scanner that ID highly
fragmented strands of DNA.

873
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,200
Things are hidden in every street lamp
across the country, which is why you've

874
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,460
got to get underground ASAP.

875
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,500
Man, if you want to ask, just ask.

876
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,280
What is that with the hot dog cart?

877
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,500
My dad was a cop.

878
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:47,650
a good cop quit in protest when the
network privatized local police he

879
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:50,730
officers should be accountable to the
towns that pay them not the government

880
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:56,990
sure as hell not the mega court so he
bought the cart busted his ass we never

881
01:17:56,990 --> 01:18:02,470
missed a meal better an honorable hot
dog vendor than a crooked goon but his

882
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:06,910
friends who signed on with the ncg
didn't appreciate his choices and they

883
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:10,840
him know every chance they got He made
damn sure we were safe in the house.

884
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:16,900
And every time he took that card out,
well, you see what I did to my mom.

885
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,640
And this is what they did to my dad.

886
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,180
His buddies on the force never solved
the case. Because they're the ones who

887
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,139
killed him.

888
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,520
But you can't kill an idea.

889
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,840
Dad was their worst nightmare.

890
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,680
A free man with a conscience.

891
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,460
And everything they destroyed in him
lives on in me.

892
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,100
Like a nuclear blast.

893
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,880
It never burns out.

894
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:48,580
Monster.

895
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,220
I'm good.

896
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,720
Any rooms?

897
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,000
You can't outrun space.

898
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,960
And you cannot hide from destiny.

899
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,740
We're back going up there.

900
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:14,420
I have a detailed map for how to get
there. You can survive down there for

901
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,120
years, but you'll only need it for two
weeks.

902
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,300
I'll pre -shoot the rest of your tapes
tomorrow.

903
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,920
What do you think?

904
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,220
Um... Or... Maybe just... White.

905
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,140
Hardcore.

906
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,620
Check this out.

907
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,460
You could be arrested just for having
the truth in your house.

908
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,560
So this won't be distributed until right
after you win.

909
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:42,839
What the hell?

910
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,320
It's a special issue on the network's
most heinous crimes.

911
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,240
What does that have to do with me?

912
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,220
A bomb's chemicals hold great power.

913
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,080
But without an initiator to make it go
boom, it's harmless.

914
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,280
You know why they cheered for you down
there?

915
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,020
They think you just might win.

916
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,080
And if you can survive against those
goons, so can they.

917
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,080
The people have had it.

918
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,200
This country's ready to blow.

919
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,340
And you're the initiator. I'm not.

920
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,720
The initiator.

921
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,180
I'm a guy trying to give back to his
family.

922
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,400
It's you against the world either way,
brother.

923
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,200
Why not be both?

924
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,700
My mom picked the bathroom across the
hall that called in, so that's all you.

925
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:36,240
If the light in the hallway is off,
she's asleep.

926
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:41,960
Hey, I appreciate what you're doing.

927
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:47,460
But if they find out you helped me,
those same goons that got your dad,

928
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:48,460
come for you.

929
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,920
What can help?

930
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:58,760
The message is that Dad needs to see you
someday.

931
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:02,560
I wanted to impart a little Dad advice.

932
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,160
Rule one.

933
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:07,730
Take care of your mom.

934
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:09,530
She's your best friend.

935
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,250
Rule two,

936
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,430
bullies are cowards.

937
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:14,690
Hit back.

938
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:20,730
Rule three, you can be kind and strong
at the same time.

939
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,130
Rule four, don't trust the network.

940
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:26,910
Ever.

941
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:34,770
And rule five, you remember your dad
loves

942
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:35,770
you a whole lot.

943
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:38,960
I'll be looking out for you.

944
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,860
No matter what.

945
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,720
Ha!

946
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:47,140
I knew it was you, devil murderer!

947
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,840
Stay away from my elf! Ma 'am! Ma 'am!
You savage!

948
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,300
Wait! Mom!

949
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,880
You'll never eat puppies again!

950
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:57,159
Mom, no!

951
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,720
Mom! It's okay! He's a friend! Help me!
No!

952
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,160
Ma 'am! Ma 'am!

953
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,480
If you press that button...

954
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:08,660
The NCG will come and fire me. Okay,
they will not care who gets caught in

955
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,420
crossfire. It will be a bloodbath.

956
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
We don't need everybody going to the
state coming through that door, right?

957
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:18,980
Don't.

958
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,500
Network community guard, what crime
would you like to report?

959
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,140
Ben Richards just broke into my home.

960
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:29,080
Okay, stay where you are. I saw you.

961
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,340
We gotta get going.

962
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,980
I just need five minutes of fun with
these guys before we do.

963
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:36,150
What? Grab your stuff. I'll get the
scenes.

964
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:46,190
They're not listening. It's dangerous.

965
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:50,970
Tom, get in the safe room. No, I didn't
want to see you die.

966
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:53,390
You hear that, Will? You're gonna die.

967
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:56,870
There.

968
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,120
Oh, yes, we do.

969
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,980
Fastest the hunters ever arrived on
scene in four minutes, 30 seconds.

970
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,360
We'll be long gone by that.

971
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,500
Hey,

972
01:23:58,060 --> 01:23:59,060
big boy.

973
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,820
You brought us up here so you could fly
down a pole? I brought us up here so we

974
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,000
could fly down a pole!

975
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,620
See?

976
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,580
Four minutes flat.

977
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,540
Told you we'd be long gone. Long gone?

978
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,260
We are still in the goddamn house!

979
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:39,140
Not for long!

980
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,650
flashlight. Pretty powerful.

981
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:54,870
Yeah.

982
01:25:56,410 --> 01:25:57,410
Come on.

983
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,050
I'm going to separate your Achilles and
drag you outside.

984
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,070
She wants to end your run in person.

985
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,330
On camera.

986
01:27:13,209 --> 01:27:16,110
Gilligan, people are dying, you fucking
psychopath.

987
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:20,510
If you can fake everything, why don't
you just fake the whole show?

988
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:25,370
Believe me, we have tried. But humans
bring that special, unpredictable spark.

989
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:28,390
The audience lives for these happy
accidents.

990
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:29,650
A little advice?

991
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:30,909
I'll pass.

992
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,510
Make sure my family gets the money.

993
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:34,250
Richards, don't go.

994
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:38,830
You can still win this game, but you
have to play it smart.

995
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:41,630
I just sent a rover into that tunnel.

996
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:49,130
You want me to offer one of your own
guys?

997
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:51,090
It's all good for me.

998
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,040
I can slow them down.

999
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,120
Take back roads to the shelter.

1000
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:49,940
Survival is the win.

1001
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,360
This way.

1002
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:01,620
Take this map.

1003
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,160
That bunker is in the middle of the
forest.

1004
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,280
Remember, Richards, you're the
initiator.

1005
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,800
Bright red blood pumps adrenaline
through your veins.

1006
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:23,720
This game is no game.

1007
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,860
Life and death are on the line.

1008
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,640
Can you feel it, Mr. Richards?

1009
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,160
Congratulations.

1010
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:33,800
You took out a hunter.

1011
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,740
Now it's down to four of them.

1012
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,820
Plus, every citizen of this great
nation.

1013
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,240
One in five pieces with the big rock.

1014
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,180
Bunkers dug into the hill.

1015
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:56,560
smell it the acorns think of fear as the
prey animal realizes he's surrounded

1016
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:02,860
by predators reality sinks in as he
scurries to hide desperately hoping to

1017
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:09,400
survive but deep down he already knows
it's too late because this is

1018
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:15,980
america god damn it and we don't pull up
with no bullshit what must is our

1019
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,700
birthright set it free

1020
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,920
Richard shows this path, and it's up to
you to show him where it ends.

1021
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:28,460
Keep your eyes open so you can see the
terror in his, and hunt him down!

1022
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:22,910
This shall never come.

1023
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:48,130
This is a method for killing.

1024
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:50,950
A dead

1025
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,260
I'm starting to get how this game works.

1026
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,240
It's not about me winning or losing.

1027
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,400
It's about your ratings.

1028
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,160
About how much chaos I can cause.

1029
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,900
I'm taking this thing all the way to the
end.

1030
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,760
And I'm done playing.

1031
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:13,260
So here's the deal.

1032
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,480
I will see my family again.

1033
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:21,900
And as long as they keep getting paid,
you can put whoever you want.

1034
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:28,540
in front of me i will run through all of
them i know you fight dirty

1035
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:35,140
or guess what you son of a i'm from
slumside let's throw the rule book out

1036
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:41,380
here's the mutually profitable
annihilation you want to go i'll give

1037
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:52,930
Let's do this.

1038
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:57,170
We interrupt the Americanos for a live
update from the running man. We don't

1039
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:59,150
like this show. The floor is done.

1040
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:03,610
We're the only ones tense enough to
think it's real. I know. It's so funny.

1041
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:05,410
Please stay still.

1042
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:10,690
Is that the U .K.? Please.

1043
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:13,850
Go, go. Get on fire.

1044
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:19,970
Drive! Take the next back road north. I
can't. My power's on empty. Your battery

1045
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:21,690
is 93 % charged.

1046
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:26,650
Those goons are going to frag us if you
don't back this car up.

1047
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:28,110
Right now!

1048
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:36,530
Your car is dead.

1049
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,050
Your car is dead.

1050
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,240
People need self -driving cars.

1051
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,880
Recalculating.

1052
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:08,820
Keep it pointed north.

1053
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,780
All the way to the border.

1054
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,220
Go ahead.

1055
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:16,140
Say what you gotta say.

1056
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,240
Why?

1057
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,440
So you can go crazy and kill me?

1058
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:22,800
No.

1059
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:25,680
You have one minute to speak freely.

1060
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,720
How do you live with yourself?

1061
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:32,300
You dare sit there and criticize my
driving?

1062
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,560
Tell me how to operate my own car?

1063
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,200
I am a member of society.

1064
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,300
You disgust me.

1065
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:44,080
You abandoned that starving baby, that
horrible wife of yours.

1066
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:45,980
You can what?

1067
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,720
Kill people for money?

1068
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,720
And you only kill the best people.

1069
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:55,280
The people who protect us from wealth
like you.

1070
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:57,420
And that's not a word I use.

1071
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,500
That is my family.

1072
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:09,200
A number finally came up for the part.

1073
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,380
Watched Kathy try ice cream for the
first time.

1074
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:16,620
That was the best day of my life.

1075
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,260
So yeah, you're right.

1076
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,400
The show is so fake.

1077
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,300
Not the bullets.

1078
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:24,660
Not the death.

1079
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,920
Just the part that makes people like you
think you're better than people like

1080
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,040
us. Let me ask you something. How much
was that scarf?

1081
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:37,270
Huh? More than the meds my daughter
needed when she was dying of the flu?

1082
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:39,190
The flu!

1083
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:43,690
That is a human life hanging around your
neck.

1084
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:47,330
You seem to be doing fine.

1085
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:50,070
Who can blame you? It's a nice scarf.

1086
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,830
I'm not a bad person.

1087
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:54,730
No, do not start crying.

1088
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:57,150
I will shoot us both if you start
crying.

1089
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,610
Cry when it's over.

1090
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:00,630
When will that be?

1091
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:05,930
Yielding for an emergency vehicle.

1092
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:11,370
Nice. Disable it. Disable it. Do not
pull. I don't know how. Yielding in 150

1093
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:12,370
feet.

1094
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,710
50 feet.

1095
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:17,610
In 20 feet.

1096
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:22,010
You have successfully yielded. Nice.

1097
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:37,160
We're here securing our homestead in the
name of the network.

1098
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,180
Don't worry, lady. We're the good guys.

1099
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,920
Just step out of the car.

1100
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:43,020
You'll be safe with us.

1101
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:44,940
It's him we want.

1102
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,740
The producers just killed an hour ago,
Chef.

1103
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:07,140
Except me.

1104
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,280
I don't do that.

1105
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,680
Those men were just trying to protect me
from you.

1106
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,440
What is it going to take for you to
get... I am not the bad guy!

1107
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,500
Take the car.

1108
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,140
Drive away. I don't want to hurt you.
You think they're going to let you walk

1109
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,140
after seeing that? You're on the show
now.

1110
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,500
No, I'm not!

1111
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:28,680
Rickards lives.

1112
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:30,530
And this time, he's got a hostage.

1113
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:34,110
Amelia Williams, a 27 -year -old realtor
from Bangor, Maine.

1114
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:35,249
Help me!

1115
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,350
He's got a gun!

1116
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:39,650
Welcome to the Running Man.

1117
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:46,810
Help me! The crisis continues as Ms.
Williams' gray Alpine heads north on

1118
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:50,690
Rock Siding Road. The hostage situation
has triggered the NCT to go into full

1119
01:38:50,690 --> 01:38:51,690
tactical alert.

1120
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:52,688
Help me!

1121
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:53,990
Turn it off. He's got a gun!

1122
01:38:54,410 --> 01:38:55,410
Just turn it off!

1123
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:16,080
Unbelievable. Yeah, it's a circus, all
right. So they're just going to keep

1124
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:16,898
filming us?

1125
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:19,860
If a runner gets good ratings, they let
him run.

1126
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,040
Oh, God.

1127
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:23,060
Is that a blocking?

1128
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,500
All right.

1129
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,620
We'll play our parts, then let us pass.

1130
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:32,959
That's it.

1131
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:33,960
Keep driving.

1132
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,080
We're not going to shoot.

1133
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,340
How do you know?

1134
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:37,980
Because they're going to wait for the
show to start.

1135
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:39,329
I'm alive.

1136
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:40,330
To what life?

1137
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:42,750
Kill me.

1138
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:52,230
Why did he turn for you when I'm a
hostage?

1139
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:55,390
Unbelievable.

1140
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:58,230
Amelia, can you give me the gun?

1141
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:00,890
Why not?

1142
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:02,150
You're obviously the hero.

1143
01:40:03,770 --> 01:40:07,730
I don't think we're going to need this
anymore.

1144
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:11,330
Oh,

1145
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,750
my God. I just saw Ben Richards.

1146
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:17,410
I'm sorry. Wait. I am Ben Richards.

1147
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:22,390
And if you don't want to be the reason
Amelia dies, get this message to

1148
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:23,730
Do what he says, please.

1149
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:25,470
You heard the lady.

1150
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,820
make up some bullshit when it had to be
done.

1151
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:06,240
Look at all these people who know the
truth.

1152
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,320
Are you willing to kill all of them?

1153
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:09,740
Because I am.

1154
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,120
I'm holding on to this bullhorn with my
right hand.

1155
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:21,420
My left hand is in my front couch,
wrapped around 12 pounds of black Irish.

1156
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:27,260
When I used to work at Network Public
Utility,

1157
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:31,670
You get these two -ton fatberg, take
less than a gram to blow those up.

1158
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:33,190
12 pounds.

1159
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:36,170
I'll vaporize everything in a half -mile
radius.

1160
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:44,650
Oh, shit.

1161
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:50,510
BFB -20 is the most highly regulated
industrial explosive. We haven't even

1162
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:52,190
foot in a state that does that.

1163
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:54,690
Guess Molly didn't tell you everything.

1164
01:41:55,070 --> 01:41:57,450
I got my finger stuck in the detonator
ring.

1165
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,940
And it's on half cock.

1166
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:03,920
So, I want one of those big, fancy,
flying V airplanes.

1167
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:07,760
I want two auto -shoots handed to Amelia
at the bottom of the ramp.

1168
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,760
If the future's out, Todd, do you make
any sudden moves?

1169
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:16,480
If you don't back those trucks up and
let me on that tarmac right fucking now,

1170
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,780
you won't even hear it go boom.

1171
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:22,580
I'll just see you in hell and laugh in
your face.

1172
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:24,260
You got one minute.

1173
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,240
Shouldn't take long.

1174
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:32,540
He's got a direct line to the boss.

1175
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:36,640
Last chance to run.

1176
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:39,140
No.

1177
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,120
You made me feel like I'm the bad guy.

1178
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:45,560
Now I have to prove I'm not.

1179
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,540
Why don't you show what I think?

1180
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,140
You're not the one I'm trying to prove
it to.

1181
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,700
Who wants our plan?

1182
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:02,420
I'm going to convince them your handbag
is a bomb long enough to bail out over

1183
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:03,420
Canada.

1184
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:08,580
They'll never let me win, so I'm going
to slip out the back door and wait out

1185
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:09,398
the clock.

1186
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:13,080
We just have to keep the audience
entertained until they cross the border.

1187
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,960
What if they call your bluff?

1188
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:22,340
You make sure they know it's real. Get
scared, freak out, curse, scream, call

1189
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,340
the worst names possible.

1190
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,380
Just remember, everything bad...

1191
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:29,990
It's all good freebie.

1192
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:35,770
Act terrified when McConey hands you the
chutes. I won't have to act.

1193
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:40,350
If he grabs his gun, you'll know it's
time to go off.

1194
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:54,530
So, you think you're the guy who stops
me from seeing my daughter again?

1195
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:55,890
So start today.

1196
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:57,730
Get on the plane.

1197
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:02,810
only if you take your mask off audience
will love it keep dreaming

1198
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,280
We'll start today.

1199
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:43,960
Welcome aboard, Mr. Richards, to the
Metair Flying V Luxury Jetliner, the

1200
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,560
ultimate in private travel.

1201
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:51,440
With state -of -the -art safety
features, this is first -class comfort

1202
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:56,960
-high. So sit back and enjoy the most
relaxing flight of your life.

1203
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,440
Welcome aboard, Mr. Richards.

1204
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,220
I'm Captain Holloway.

1205
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:04,000
You'll excuse me if I don't shake your
hand.

1206
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:09,220
That's First Officer Dunninger and
Navigation Officer Donahue to your left.

1207
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:11,700
Looks like you're missing one.

1208
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:17,180
Hey, Captain. How many lavatories are on
this rust bucket?

1209
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,400
Four. Six.

1210
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,020
Why don't you check them all for
stowaways?

1211
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:26,060
Anyone sneaks up on me, it's gonna be a
real short ride.

1212
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,800
So where are we headed tonight?

1213
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:32,480
Plot a route over the richest homes from
here to Canada.

1214
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:35,840
Fly as low as you can. Let me know when
we're 10 minutes from the border.

1215
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,500
As you wish.

1216
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:54,480
Hey, Richard.

1217
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,140
Six minutes to showtime.

1218
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:59,710
You should get that last meal before
they clear me to blow your head off in

1219
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:01,090
front of a couple billion people.

1220
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:02,450
Oh, yeah?

1221
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:05,570
You know, you could really put some
makeup on before the show starts.

1222
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:06,870
Fuck the show!

1223
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:07,789
Let's go.

1224
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:08,728
Oh, you want to go?

1225
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:10,750
We can all go right now! Just stop!

1226
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:14,090
Do it! Do it, tough guy! Why are you
doing this?

1227
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:15,870
See my twitch. Show him the bomb!

1228
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:19,090
Show it to him before he shoots you and
kills us all!

1229
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:20,630
Don't show it!

1230
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:23,350
Because I don't want to feel like this
anymore!

1231
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:25,370
Do you fucking hear me? I'm done!

1232
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:27,329
I'm done!

1233
01:46:27,330 --> 01:46:30,470
Richard, what if I offer you an amnesty
deal and an exit visa?

1234
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:32,250
You're nothing but a Halloween costume.

1235
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:33,710
You can't offer me shit.

1236
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:35,190
You're true, Mr. Richards.

1237
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:39,650
You can, but I can't. How about I offer
you a deal?

1238
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:44,810
You tell your hunters in the cockpit to
do what I tell them, otherwise I blow up

1239
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:46,730
this shit and everyone on it!

1240
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:50,770
Dan, I admire your commitment to the
bet, but we're short on time, so...

1241
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,280
I'll be blunt.

1242
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,160
We know you're bluffing.

1243
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:58,780
Flying V Mark II has scanners built into
the doors.

1244
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:01,740
It's been wildly entertaining.

1245
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:05,400
But you can give Amelia her lovely
handbag back now.

1246
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,760
Evan?

1247
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,480
Evan? Don't.

1248
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:16,820
That's game.

1249
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,420
Safe to that weapon, sir. Evan, are you
insane?

1250
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,400
The show hasn't even started. Hand over
your gun and go to the back of the jet.

1251
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,700
Thank you.

1252
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:33,300
You can remain there until I say
otherwise.

1253
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:40,280
I need a moment to have a word with Mr.
Richards to discuss a sensitive matter.

1254
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,220
Let's keep this between us.

1255
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:52,030
It wasn't too long ago that someone with
my job thought it was more important to

1256
01:47:52,030 --> 01:47:56,450
force some hypocritical moral message
down society's throat than to simply

1257
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:57,890
entertain them.

1258
01:47:58,790 --> 01:48:02,450
They forgot about the power of illusion,
the power of the star, which is what

1259
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:03,450
you are, Richards.

1260
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:06,310
And this is why we want to offer you
your own show.

1261
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:07,750
Now picture it.

1262
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:13,510
A former runner, redeemed through
righteous vengeance, turns his life

1263
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:15,550
become a lethal force for good.

1264
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,880
They call him the Hunter.

1265
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:24,080
The board has authorized me to pay you
five million new dollars per season.

1266
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:25,460
There's only one condition.

1267
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:31,320
Sit back, watch the intro, and we're
bobbing you to kill every Hunter on that

1268
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,320
jet.

1269
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:36,000
Conditions met, I'll remote pilot you
back to the studio jet port where the

1270
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,420
President of the United States will
induct you as Hunter number six.

1271
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,880
Another title idea I'm playing with.

1272
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:44,500
The data says the revenge plot. Revenge.

1273
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:46,620
Revenge for what?

1274
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:49,880
Who is going to root for a guy who kills
your national heroes?

1275
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,780
I call bullshit, Dan.

1276
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,080
Let me worry about the creative.

1277
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:55,740
No deal.

1278
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:57,020
The truth, then.

1279
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:01,720
Revenge for your wife and child.

1280
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,720
Why would I ever believe you?

1281
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:08,340
Because.

1282
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:12,560
If they were still alive, I'd hold them
at gunpoint and force you to do whatever

1283
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,560
I want.

1284
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:15,480
You torture them right in front of you.

1285
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:20,180
I didn't want to show you this, but I'm
out of time to save your life.

1286
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,900
The hunter you killed was part of a
tight crew.

1287
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:29,680
McCone and the men in that cockpit flew
to Co -op City to Sheila and Kathy's

1288
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,820
secret uptown location.

1289
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,160
They badged their way past the family
alliance agents.

1290
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,480
I'm sorry, Ben.

1291
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,940
Not all accidents are happy.

1292
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,900
The audience is already on your side.

1293
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:57,440
Once I show them footage of McCone and
his men killing your family, they will

1294
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:58,760
follow you into hell.

1295
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:01,500
Think of what this does for your
narrative.

1296
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,660
30 seconds to showtime, Ben.

1297
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:09,580
You'll find a gun by the coffee station
in the galley. But if you don't sign

1298
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:13,160
before the theme music ends, I'll order
the bastards that killed your family to

1299
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:14,160
kill you too.

1300
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,240
Tune in and find out.

1301
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:44,400
Everyone, everyone, please help.

1302
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:45,660
Help, help.

1303
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:47,420
Running Man.

1304
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,480
We start today's episode with a heavy
heart.

1305
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:54,380
We here at The Running Man believe in
following the rules.

1306
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,120
So it pains me to tell you that one of
our most important rules...

1307
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:02,380
has been broken by the very men we
entrust to enforce them.

1308
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:05,540
Chief McCollum and his hunters.

1309
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:11,200
And that rule is, we protect the
Runner's family from harm.

1310
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,660
No one would believe we didn't.

1311
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:22,120
We thought it only fair to let Richards
administer the penalty for this grave

1312
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,120
infraction.

1313
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:26,080
As we go along, it's Richard's.

1314
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:33,910
Hey, Richards.

1315
01:51:34,190 --> 01:51:35,330
You're making coffee?

1316
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:37,010
Yeah.

1317
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:38,430
How do you... Take it!

1318
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:09,870
I'm sitting alone.

1319
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,110
I'm sitting alone.

1320
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:13,690
I'm sitting alone.

1321
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:15,190
I'm sitting

1322
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:21,570
alone.

1323
01:52:54,919 --> 01:52:58,220
And then, there was one.

1324
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:06,300
Three hunters down, but the deadliest
among them is still somewhere on this

1325
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:11,320
He took the other parachute. I couldn't
stop him.

1326
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:13,600
Strap that on.

1327
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:17,630
keep your head down the prey has become
the predator

1328
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:02,380
It all comes down to this.

1329
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:06,640
You

1330
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:15,100
want

1331
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:17,120
to know who's stopping you from beating
your kid again?

1332
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:45,360
This is how they fire me, what do you
think they'll do to you?

1333
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:51,860
You think you're the only runner ever
got offered a deal?

1334
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:55,740
You think surviving two weeks in pain
makes you big shit?

1335
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:00,560
Try 29 days.

1336
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:02,940
What's more likely?

1337
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,420
A. I killed your family.

1338
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:10,620
B. Killian sold you just the right lie
to get a bloodbath season finale.

1339
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:12,240
Or C.

1340
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:15,040
You're too fucking stupid to figure it
out.

1341
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:20,680
Take it from someone who took the deal
to be a hunter instead of the hunted.

1342
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:25,380
The only time you'll ever see your
family again is when they torture them

1343
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:26,380
front of you.

1344
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:29,680
Fuck with your head enough to make you
want to kill it all away.

1345
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:31,300
You're full of shit.

1346
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,660
You're all full of shit.

1347
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:39,480
Truth is, I'm doing you a favor.

1348
01:55:49,179 --> 01:55:50,700
Hey, Gillian!

1349
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:53,620
You think I needed time to waste, this
loser?

1350
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,900
You outran fate!

1351
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:28,760
That's game.

1352
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:45,200
Can I borrow your scarf?

1353
01:56:56,830 --> 01:56:58,070
Let's take him back on the ground.

1354
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:03,590
This shoe should open on its own.

1355
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:05,750
But if it doesn't, just let her rip.

1356
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:09,970
When you get on the ground, just run
like hell. Go with that.

1357
01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:15,130
When I tell you, you're going to pull
that down all the way.

1358
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:20,090
I'm sorry they did this to you.

1359
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:22,770
I did it to myself.

1360
01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:55,969
Not this.

1361
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:58,430
Ben Richards, you are the man.

1362
01:57:58,850 --> 01:58:00,630
We have commanded the jet.

1363
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:05,110
Best trauma surgeons are already on the
tarmac, ready to patch you up as good as

1364
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:06,770
new. But wait.

1365
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:10,690
Making his freebie debut with a special
message.

1366
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:16,190
The creator of Running Man, super
producer Dan Killian.

1367
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:22,830
Mr. Richards, we here at the network
believe you embody the raw strength.

1368
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:27,440
strength, and salt of the earth moral
backbone this country stands for. And we

1369
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:31,040
want, no, we need to see more.

1370
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:35,940
This summer, Ben Richards is 106.

1371
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:40,120
Congratulations, Ben, and welcome to the
network family.

1372
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:41,600
I already got a family.

1373
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:44,580
Did you kill him or not, Dan?

1374
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,020
Give it up for Dan Killian.

1375
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:57,930
times do you get to tell 2 billion
people how you really feel?

1376
01:58:58,710 --> 01:59:00,370
How does it feel to be a hero, Ben?

1377
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:05,090
Nothing I've done on the show makes me a
hero.

1378
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:09,210
I tried to be a hero once.

1379
01:59:09,950 --> 01:59:11,570
I've been blacklisted in my ass.

1380
01:59:15,110 --> 01:59:16,710
My daughter got sick.

1381
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:21,830
This is the only job I could get.

1382
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:30,140
Seems like the whole point of freebie is
to make us hate each other so

1383
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:32,300
they can keep stealing from us.

1384
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:38,840
When we fight in the mud, you want the
truth.

1385
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:41,980
Turn it off.

1386
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,500
We are all being fucked by the network.

1387
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:48,640
Find out who really runs it.

1388
01:59:49,820 --> 01:59:51,620
Record. Report them.

1389
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:54,320
Get their names.

1390
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,260
You just met one of them.

1391
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:58,000
Dan Killian.

1392
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,920
You remember that face.

1393
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:05,520
Don't watch for me.

1394
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:08,500
Watch who pays for it.

1395
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,720
Turn it off.

1396
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:23,640
Great speech.

1397
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:27,080
Too bad I'm the only one who saw it.

1398
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:31,180
We've been on an ad break since you said
nothing you did on the show made you a

1399
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:35,600
hero. You think it was worth it? You
think your little rant made you a

1400
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:38,040
We're going live again in 30.

1401
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:42,380
This time you'll play your part, because
if not, I'm gonna run this instead.

1402
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:47,600
I told you I was gonna burn this
building down and everyone in it!

1403
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:50,480
That was fast.

1404
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:51,840
Work with me, Richards.

1405
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:53,080
Don't throw your life away.

1406
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:56,320
Don't make me fly that jet into the
network building.

1407
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,520
They'll blow you out of the sky.

1408
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:02,000
Are they dead or alive, Dan?

1409
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:07,580
Who? My family. Who cares? If I told you
they were alive, would you even believe

1410
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:13,460
me? We are alive in five, four, three,
two, one.

1411
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:15,680
Now, okay, have it your way.

1412
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:18,420
I told you I was gonna burn this
building!

1413
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:28,669
Are you insane?

1414
02:01:28,670 --> 02:01:30,830
There's 5 ,000 innocent people in this
building!

1415
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:31,850
Look

1416
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:38,750
at what

1417
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:39,750
you've done.

1418
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:41,830
Are you happy?

1419
02:01:42,690 --> 02:01:44,930
I told you I was gonna fuck you up.

1420
02:01:45,450 --> 02:01:46,450
Yeah.

1421
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:52,630
The main column, everyone!

1422
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:55,410
The NCT will blow him out of the sky!

1423
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:15,070
true believers let's wind that back beth
richards

1424
02:02:15,070 --> 02:02:20,990
legend the network wants you to think
that on day 18 of his run after taking

1425
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:25,830
all five hunters the longest surviving
contestants in season one committed

1426
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:32,200
suicide by surface to air missile The
apostle calls bullshit. First of all,

1427
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:36,840
cut the ad six minutes earlier than
usual and ran them for twice as long.

1428
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,400
must have needed the time to write this
fake ass shit.

1429
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:42,800
I will sit you in hell and laugh in your
face.

1430
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:45,540
And then they swamped the crowd.

1431
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:50,760
Where did Purple Shirt Guy come from?
Season 5, episode 13 to be exact.

1432
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:56,220
That's how dumb the network thinks we
are. Their biodistortions meant none of

1433
02:02:56,220 --> 02:03:01,820
knew the truth about what happened on
that jet until a revolutionary riot girl

1434
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:07,740
found the jet's black box on the roof of
her co -op. Her uncle had the audio

1435
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:11,200
duped, distributed, and put it on blast.

1436
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:12,780
Turn it off.

1437
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:16,080
And God damn it, did we ever.

1438
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:20,530
The network wasn't about to give us the
gospel, so we learned how to give it to

1439
02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:26,350
each other. Ben let the fuse, and the
truth exploded like a newly applied

1440
02:03:26,350 --> 02:03:28,110
the network even knew it existed.

1441
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:29,790
Don't watch freebie.

1442
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:31,730
Watch who pays for it.

1443
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:34,430
But questions remain about that fateful
night.

1444
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:38,810
Keep going, kid! Did the hunters really
assassinate Ben's family?

1445
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:43,910
Did Killian sell him just the right lie
for a bloodbath season finale? And the

1446
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:45,830
big one on everyone's mind.

1447
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:48,110
Did Ben survive?

1448
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:53,350
The Apostles' research reveals that one
of the flying V Mark II state -of -the

1449
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:58,470
-art safety features was a crew escape
pod just about the size of this so

1450
02:03:58,470 --> 02:03:59,449
-called debris.

1451
02:03:59,450 --> 02:04:05,790
Did Ben cheat death one last time? Stop
filming me! The network won't say, but

1452
02:04:05,790 --> 02:04:06,790
one thing's for sure.

1453
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:12,410
He's still here, you shit -eaters.

1454
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:45,590
These are adorable.

1455
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:47,350
Oh, no, sorry, those aren't mine.

1456
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:50,350
The guy outside bought them for you,
Mrs. Richards.

1457
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:52,410
Groceries, too.

1458
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:28,710
You were indeed a tough actor.

1459
02:05:29,230 --> 02:05:31,250
Where do you think you're going?

1460
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:32,810
You don't hear that?

1461
02:05:33,070 --> 02:05:36,790
I'd say that's some valuable audience
feedback, Dan. No, no, no. You get back

1462
02:05:36,790 --> 02:05:39,470
out there and you do your job. How about
you do my job?

1463
02:05:40,190 --> 02:05:44,070
Hey, I've been crushing the ratings for
20 years. I own that audience. You don't

1464
02:05:44,070 --> 02:05:45,130
think I can turn this around?

1465
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:47,370
You're the one who wanted to make him a
star, Dan.

1466
02:05:47,810 --> 02:05:48,810
Mission accomplished.

1467
02:05:49,070 --> 02:05:50,070
It's his show now.

1468
02:05:52,510 --> 02:05:54,030
You think he could just walk?

1469
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:59,060
Sweeties. Please, take another look at
my contract.

1470
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:04,660
Page 42, paragraph 6. There's a special
clause in the smallest effect that

1471
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:06,240
reads, Fuck you.

1472
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:07,740
Ten seconds?

1473
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:08,820
Ten seconds, Dan.

1474
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:11,960
Coco, come on, let's go.

1475
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:13,720
You know what?

1476
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:14,839
Fuck that.

1477
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:17,060
This is my house. I set the rules.

1478
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:21,180
Max and Steve, drown them out. Sir, are
you sure this is like the thing right

1479
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:22,180
now?

1480
02:07:43,790 --> 02:07:44,790
And action.
