    <p style="font-size:1rem; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:15px;">
      Founded in <strong>2022</strong>, The Wave began humbly on WhatsApp — a small space where entertainment lovers could share exciting updates and creative ideas. As our passion and community grew, we expanded fully into Telegram, creating a broader platform for engagement.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1rem; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:15px;">
      Our mission is to <strong>revive the greatness of entertainment that feels lost</strong> — and make it even better. Driven by an obsession for improvement, we constantly push boundaries to deliver content that blends <strong>entertainment</strong> and <strong>enlightenment</strong>.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1rem; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:15px;">
      As <strong>software programmers</strong>, we thought — why not mix technology with our love for entertainment and create a platform that brings it all together? That’s how this site was born: a digital home where creativity, storytelling, and innovation meet.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1rem; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:15px;">
      From <strong>WaveNews</strong> to <strong>WaveMovies</strong> and <strong>WaveComics</strong>, we’re dedicated to bringing fresh, exciting, and inspiring updates to everyone who loves stories, creativity, and innovation.
