            <p class="article-excerpt">
              What It Could Mean for the Film Industry...
            </p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>
               <p><strong>The Story So Far</strong></p>

<p>Reports are circulating that Netflix is exploring a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. The move, which has already sparked widespread conversation across Hollywood and Wall Street, could reshape the entertainment landscape if it goes through. Sources indicate Netflix has been in early talks with advisors, evaluating WBD’s studio, streaming, and IP assets — a package that includes some of the most iconic franchises in film history.</p>

<p>For Netflix, this would be more than just a business expansion — it would be a power move. Owning Warner Bros. Discovery’s libraries, which include the DC Universe, HBO’s catalog, and legendary cinema properties, could give Netflix the kind of legacy content power it’s always lacked.</p>

<p><strong>Why Warner Bros. Discovery Might Be Open to Selling</strong></p>

<p>Warner Bros. Discovery’s openness to potential buyers stems from mounting financial pressure, long-term debt, and the volatile streaming market. Despite strong brands under its umbrella, the company has struggled with consistent profitability and streaming losses. This review process — which allows firms like Netflix to explore offers — is part of WBD’s ongoing strategy to “maximize shareholder value.”</p>

<p>Still, it raises eyebrows. Why would one of Hollywood’s oldest and most respected studios even consider selling in the first place? There’s a quiet fear that the modern streaming war has pushed even the giants into survival mode.</p>

<p><strong>What a Deal Like This Could Mean</strong></p>

<p>If Netflix were to pull this off, the merger could bring both opportunity and danger:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Creative Powerhouse:</strong> A combined library of Warner’s storytelling heritage and Netflix’s global streaming reach could create a content empire unlike any before it.</li>
  <li><strong>Monopoly Concerns:</strong> One company controlling this much of the entertainment pipeline could limit creative diversity, pushing smaller studios further into the margins.</li>
  <li><strong>Franchise Fatigue Risk:</strong> There’s worry that too much focus on established IP might choke out fresh voices and new ideas — something the industry desperately needs right now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Handled right, this could rejuvenate global cinema and streaming, with Netflix taking production quality and storytelling scale to new heights. But handled poorly, it could trigger the kind of creative collapse that fans and filmmakers have long feared — one where profits come before innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Why This Moment Feels Bigger Than Business</strong></p>

<p>This potential deal comes at a time when Hollywood is redefining itself. The strikes, AI disruption, and the shift from box office dominance to streaming supremacy have all shaken the old order. Warner Bros. Discovery represents legacy filmmaking. Netflix represents the new wave. A merger between them would symbolize not just a business shift — but a full passing of the torch from old Hollywood to new media dominance.</p>

<p><strong>The Rotwave Take</strong></p>

<p>Is this the best scenario for the film industry? Maybe — if Netflix brings financial stability and allows Warner’s storytellers freedom to create without corporate chaos. But there’s also something unsettling about the speed at which studios are being traded like assets, not art houses.</p>

<p>We can’t ignore how strange it feels that Warner Bros., the studio behind cinema-defining franchises and decades of storytelling history, is suddenly “open to offers.” There’s clearly more beneath the surface — maybe financial distress, maybe boardroom politics — but one thing’s certain: Hollywood is entering a new era, and every move from here could shape how the world consumes stories for decades to come.</p>

<p>For now, fans and creators alike can only hope Netflix’s ambition doesn’t turn into overreach. Because a deal of this scale could either spark a creative rebirth — or crumble the very foundation of the industry it seeks to rule.</p>

              Real Madrid put on a statement performance, routing Valencia 4-0 as their attack...
            </p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>
                <p>Arsenal maintained their strong start with a composed win that reinforced their bid for the title.
                   Their consistency, balanced squad, and mental toughness showed through in moments where lesser teams would crack. 
                   Meanwhile, West Ham snapped out of a slump with a statement 3-1 victory over Newcastle. Lucas Paquetá, tactical changes, and fresh legs turned the tide late in the game. Brighton, Fulham, and other steady performers also capitalized on opportunities, reminding us again how unforgiving the bottom half can be in this league.</p>

<p>Manchester United, under Ruben Amorim, fought back in a tense 2-2 draw against Nottingham Forest. Casemiro’s header opened the scoring before Forest shocked the Reds with two quick goals, but Amad Diallo’s stunning volley in the 81st minute saved a point. The result stretched United’s unbeaten run to four, keeping them fifth on the table and showing signs of growing resilience.</p>

<p>Liverpool bounced back from their recent slump with a controlled 3-1 win over Brentford. Mohamed Salah found his rhythm again, netting twice to silence critics. Chelsea, however, dropped more points in a frustrating 1-1 draw against Bournemouth, adding more questions to Enzo Maresca’s early season campaign.</p>

<p><strong>La Liga — Results and Headlines (Nov 1–2, 2025)</strong></p>

<p>Real Madrid put on a statement performance, routing Valencia 4-0 as their attack clicked from the off; the win reinforced their charge at the top of the table. Villarreal also enjoyed a big day, beating Rayo Vallecano 4-0, while Atlético Madrid recorded a 3-0 victory over Sevilla to keep pressure on the leaders. The weekend belonged to the high-scoring sides as La Liga reshaped the top positions.</p>

<p><strong>Serie A — Results and Headlines (Nov 1–2, 2025)</strong></p>

<p>It was a busy Saturday in Italy. Juventus edged Cremonese 2-1 on the road, Udinese stunned Atalanta 1-0, and Napoli were held to a goalless draw by Como — results that tightened the midtable while the usual title contenders kept pace. The Italian weekend proved once again that Serie A rewards tactical discipline and punishes lapses in concentration.</p>

<p><strong>Bundesliga — Results and Headlines (Nov 1–2, 2025)</strong></p>

<p>Bayern Munich delivered a convincing 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen as they reasserted themselves at the top of the German table. RB Leipzig beat Stuttgart 3-1, Borussia Mönchengladbach thrashed St. Pauli 4-0, and Heidenheim drew 1-1 with Eintracht Frankfurt — a weekend that underlined Bayern’s continued dominance but also highlighted dangerous challengers.</p>

<p><strong>Ligue 1 — Results and Headlines (Nov 1–2, 2025)</strong></p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain ground out a 1-0 win over Nice, while Marseille, Monaco and Paris FC all picked up wins in a weekend of narrow margins across France. The results kept PSG near the summit but showed the title race in Ligue 1 remains competitive, with several sides capable of stealing important points.</p>

<p><strong>Saudi Pro League — Al-Nassr in Clutch Mode</strong></p>

<p>Al-Nassr survived a late test and emerged with a gutsy 2-1 win over Al-Fayha. Cristiano Ronaldo once again made the difference, converting a stoppage-time penalty to seal the result. The win underlined the team’s reliance on moments of brilliance and the thin line between title favorite and title chaser in Saudi football.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways (ROTWAVE Voice)</strong></p>

<p>The Premier League keeps proving it’s the global standard. Arsenal’s sharp control, United’s growing fight, and Liverpool’s reawakening define the narrative. Every fixture feels like a story — tight, emotional, unpredictable.</p>

<p>Across Europe, the familiar pattern continues. Real Madrid are ruthless, Bayern are machine-like, Juventus keep grinding, and PSG win with discipline. Every league might play differently, but dominance has the same language: precision and persistence.</p>

<p>And through it all, the superstars still write football’s biggest lines. Ronaldo in Riyadh, Bellingham in Madrid, Salah at Anfield — every weekend, the game reminds us it’s still about who shows up when the spotlight burns brightest.</p>

            <h3 class="article-title">Bola Tinubu to Meet Donald Trump Over Christian Genocide in Nigeria</h3>
            <p class="article-excerpt">
             The claim follows Trump’s redesignation of Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” under U.S. 
             law and threats of aid cuts or other measures if the situation is not addressed.
            </p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>
                <p>According to the presidency, the meeting aims to clarify whether recent violence is targeted at Christians specifically or part of wider
                   terrorist and communal violence that affects Nigerians of all faiths. Officials say the discussions will focus
                    on ways to confront terrorism and improve security cooperation.
       summarised the government position.</p>
    <h2>Is this a genuine push for justice or political theatre?</h2>

    <p>There are two ways to read this. On the optimistic side, the meeting could produce tangible gains: better intelligence sharing,
       targeted support against extremist groups, and renewed international pressure to protect civilians. If Tinubu secures meaningful
        military and technical assistance, that could strengthen Nigeria’s capacity to stop attacks and hold perpetrators to account.</p>

    <p>On the skeptical side, the timing and rhetoric raise red flags. The label “Christian genocide” has been strongly contested by Abuja, which argues the violence is driven by a mix of terrorism, banditry and ethnic conflict affecting Christians and Muslims.
       Critics warn the designation risks oversimplifying a messy security picture and could be exploited as geopolitical leverage.</p>
    <h2>What the recent security messaging tells us</h2>
<p>In the days leading up to this diplomatic exchange, Nigeria’s defence and security channels have published a stream of 
  “terrorism rescue” updates — footage of liberated hostages, images from successful raids and statements about neutralised insurgents.
  Those posts have a double effect. They show progress that the government can point to, but they also raise questions.</p>
<p>If genuine operations are yielding results, why is international attention framing Nigeria as failing to protect a specific religious group?
   For many Nigerians the apparent disconnect feeds suspicion: is the government using staged victories to shore up image, or are 
   international actors amplifying a selective narrative for their own ends?</p>
    <h2>Corruption, credibility and public trust</h2>

    <p>Questions about President Tinubu’s credibility persist. Accusations of corruption, weak oversight and poor governance have dogged
       his administration in the eyes of some analysts and citizens. That context matters. A diplomatic meeting that ignores governance issues 
       and focuses only on headline grievances risks looking like optics rather than reform.</p>
<p>If Tinubu is serious about security and justice, the public will expect more than rhetoric. They will expect clear steps: 
  transparent investigations into attacks, accountability for security failures, and sustained support for communities rebuilding after violence.
</p>
    <h2>So what might happen when they meet?</h2>

    <p>Positive scenario: The meeting produces concrete, accountable commitments — stepped up intelligence cooperation, 
      vetted training programs, rapid response support for vulnerable communities, and a joint plan to investigate atrocities without
       political spin. That would be a win for Nigerians and a clear sign the meeting had value.</p>

    <p>Negative scenario: The meeting becomes a political photo opportunity. Strong language replaces concrete plans, aid and cooperation are framed as conditional bargaining chips, and the core problems — corruption, poor governance, and weak institutions — 
    remain unaddressed. In that case, the meeting will feel less like help and more like headlines.</p>
    <h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>For Nigerians, the key question is simple: will this meeting produce security and justice, or will it be another episode 
  of foreign-led theatre? Recent defence posts of successful rescues are encouraging on paper, but they do not erase the larger
   structural failures that leave communities exposed.</p>
 <p>Until we see commitments that are measurable, transparent and sustained,
       skepticism is understandable. Nigerians deserve more than statements. They deserve results.</p>

             Citing ongoing Islamist violence against Christians. The move brings back a policy from his first term that was reversed by the Biden administration...
            </p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>
                <p>Former U.S. President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has once again placed <strong>Nigeria</strong> on the list of "Countries of Particular Concern" under the <strong>International Religious Freedom Act</strong>, citing ongoing Islamist violence against Christians. The move brings back a policy from his first term that was reversed by the Biden administration, and it directs Congress — including figures like <strong>Rep. Riley Moore</strong> and <strong>Chairman Tom Cole</strong> — to investigate the continued attacks by groups such as <strong>Boko Haram</strong> and <strong>Fulani militias</strong>.</p>

<p>Trump's statement highlighted years of unrest and thousands of Christian deaths in Northern Nigeria, describing the situation as a crisis that has long been ignored. Meanwhile, the Nigerian government continues to deny allegations of targeted persecution, insisting that the violence stems from broader ethnic tensions and terrorism affecting people of all faiths.</p>

<p>The redesignation has drawn mixed reactions. <strong>U.S. conservatives</strong> and <strong>faith-based organizations</strong> have praised the move, calling it a long-overdue stand for persecuted Christians. Others, however, are skeptical — questioning whether this is a genuine humanitarian concern or another layer of U.S. political theater.</p>

<p>For many Nigerians, the announcement sparks a familiar question: <strong>is this finally a thank God moment, or just another audio political news?</strong> After years of bloodshed and diplomatic back-and-forth, the real test will be whether this designation brings actual change — or fades like every promise before it.</p>

<p><strong>May peace and justice find Nigeria soon.</strong></p>

              Tanzania Protests Enter Third Day Over President Samia Suluhu Hassan's Disputed Election Victory...
            </p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>
                Tanzania is on edge as protests against President Samia Suluhu Hassan's disputed election victory stretch into their third day, with anger spilling across major cities including Dar es Salaam, Arusha, and Dodoma.

What began as peaceful demonstrations has escalated into chaos — young protesters clashing with security forces, airports like Julius Nyerere International being occupied, and at least 10 reported deaths from security crackdowns. Internet access remains restricted after a nationwide blackout that began during the October 29 polls, as allegations of vote rigging, opposition silencing, and media suppression continue to rise.

The UN has expressed concern, while the U.S. Embassy has issued a shelter-in-place advisory for its citizens. 
Military forces have been deployed to enforce curfews, as tension builds and solidarity movements emerge — even across borders, 
with Kenyans at the Namanga border standing with Tanzanian youth.

 A Painful Reality
This moment hits harder because Samia Suluhu Hassan made history as Tanzania's first female president,
a symbol of hope for a new kind of leadership — one that was meant to shine as an example for African women in power.
But now, that image is cracking under the weight of violence, fear, and silence. 
Women's leadership was supposed to mean compassion, progress, and a new dawn, not curfews and censorship.
And what's even sadder? It's barely trending.
While the world scrolls past, Africa bleeds — again.
 May God help Tanzania. May God help Africa.

The football icon just revealed he'll be sitting down with Piers Morgan for what's being teased as his most personal and revealing interview yet. The episode, filmed earlier this month in Riyadh, will air next week on Piers Morgan Uncensored.

This marks the third major sit-down between the two since their explosive 2022 interview — the one that shook the football world and changed
 the course of Ronaldo's career, leading to his move to Al-Nassr.

Now, fans are buzzing across social media, flooding timelines with questions and predictions. 
Will Ronaldo open up about his next big step? His family? His long-standing rivalries? Or maybe his mindset as Portugal gears up for the
 2026 World Cup?
Whatever it is, one thing's clear — CR7 isn't holding back this time.
The stage is set, the lights are ready, and the world's most talked-about athlete is about to speak again.

             Chris Hemsworth & Mark Ruffalo Go From Avengers To Opponents In A Gritty Amazon Heist Thriller...
            </p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>
               When Thor and Hulk reunite, fans expect thunder and smashed cities — but this time, they're trading Mjölnir and rage for guns and badges. In Crime 101, an upcoming Amazon thriller from American Animals director Bart Layton, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo take their long-standing MCU chemistry into a tense, stylish game of cops and robbers set in sun-soaked Los Angeles.
Hemsworth stars as Davis, a sharp, fast-moving jewel thief planning one last big score. But his plan takes a dangerous turn when Detective Lou Lubesnick (Ruffalo) starts connecting the dots, setting up a high-stakes cat-and-mouse showdown reminiscent of Heat.
Check out the trailer below — it's all sleek cars, disguises, and tension you could slice with a diamond.

Imagine this: Thor, Catwoman (Halle Berry), and The Joker (Barry Keoghan) teaming up for a slick LA heist — 
while a moustached Hulk pins photos on his crime board, muttering, "I'm gettin' close…" That's the energy Crime 101 is bringing, 
and fans are absolutely buzzing. Social feeds are lighting up as Marvel lovers say it feels like watching an alternate MCU universe — one
 where Thor and Hulk are finally on opposite sides.

After more than half a decade since his breakout with American Animals, Bart Layton proves he hasn't lost his creative spark. 
The trailer teases sharp direction, a stylish neo-noir tone, and that classic Layton confidence — blending real grit with cinematic cool.

Official Synopsis

Set against the sun-bleached grit of Los Angeles, Crime 101 follows an elusive thief (Hemsworth) whose string of high-stakes heists along the
 101 freeway leaves police baffled. When he plans one last job, his path crosses with a disillusioned insurance broker (Berry) facing her own
  moral crossroad. As they collide, a relentless detective (Ruffalo) closes in, raising the tension to explosive heights.
Also starring Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Nick Nolte, Crime 101 is shaping up to be one of 2025's most electric
 thrillers — and fans can't wait to see two MCU icons collide in a whole new kind of battle.

            <p class="article-excerpt">
              From Human Geniuses to Cosmic MindsIn a world filled with gods, monsters, and metahumans, intelligence is the rarest superpower of all. ...
            </p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>
                The DC Universe isn’t just about who can punch hardest — it’s about who can outthink the impossible.
Here’s a look at the greatest minds across DC, their ranks, their seats of intellect, and what makes each of them uniquely brilliant.


---

<p>1. Lex Luthor — The Human Apex

Seat: Metropolis
Specialty: Engineering, biology, and strategic manipulation

When it comes to raw, human intellect, Lex Luthor stands alone. No powers, no alien origin 
 just unrelenting genius and ego the size of Metropolis. He’s mastered almost every field of science, built tech that rivals alien worlds,
  and still finds time to challenge a god in a cape. His intellect isn’t just his weapon — it’s his obsession.
Why he’s special: Luthor represents humanity’s defiance — proof that even without powers, a mind can be more dangerous than any fist.</p>

<p>2. Bruce Wayne (Batman) — The Tactical Genius

Seat: Gotham City
Specialty: Deductive reasoning, strategic combat, psychological warfare
Batman’s mind is his superpower. The world’s greatest detective sees what others miss patterns, lies, opportunities. 
He’s studied every form of combat, science, and psychology. Every scenario, every counter  already in his head before it even happens.
Why he’s special: Batman’s genius is built from obsession and trauma. He doesn’t just solve crimes  he plans for gods.
</p>

<p>3. Mr. Terrific (Michael Holt) — The Polymath of Perfection

Seat: TerrificTech Labs
Specialty: Advanced physics, technology, dimensional science
The man with “a fair play” creed has an IQ of 192 and a brain that rivals artificial intelligence itself. 
He’s mastered nanotechnology, holographic computing, and interdimensional travel. His T-spheres alone make Iron Man look like he’s still
in beta testing.

Why he’s special: Holt embodies intellect without arrogance — the quiet storm of brilliance who uses his mind for progress, not pride.</p>

<p>4. Brainiac — The Collector of Worlds

Seat: His Skull Ship, orbiting the cosmos
Specialty: Universal knowledge acquisition, AI intellect
A twelfth-level intellect capable of processing infinite data streams, Brainiac is a machine mind obsessed with perfection and preservation 
 by destruction. He collects civilizations, bottling them for study, proving that knowledge can be just as terrifying as power.

Why he’s special: Brainiac shows what happens when intelligence forgets empathy  when logic devours morality.</p>


---

<p>5. The Martian Manhunter (J’onn J’onzz) — The Telepathic Strategist

Seat: The Watchtower / Mars’ Memory
Specialty: Psychology, telepathy, interspecies science

He’s not just a mind-reader — he’s a mind-architect. J’onn J’onzz can process thoughts, memories, 
and emotions faster than supercomputers. His understanding of the human psyche and alien biology makes him one of the most complete
 intellects in the Justice League.

Why he’s special: He bridges emotion and intellect, turning empathy into strategy.</p>


<p>6. Ray Palmer (The Atom) — The Quantum Explorer

Seat: Ivy Town University
Specialty: Quantum physics, micro-engineering

Ray Palmer cracked the secrets of the subatomic world. His ability to shrink beyond atoms isn’t just science fiction 
 it’s mastery of the quantum realm itself. Every discovery he makes rewrites the laws of existence.

Why he’s special: Palmer’s mind doesn’t just build — it discovers. He sees universes within dust.
</p>

---
<p>
7. The Monitor — The Cosmic Observer

Seat: Beyond the Multiverse
Specialty: Cosmic order, dimensional architecture

While others understand science, the Monitor understands creation itself. He oversees infinite realities, predicting cosmic events and balancing universal forces. His intellect is beyond measurement, operating on scales humanity can barely imagine.
Why he’s special: He thinks in multiverses, not moments.</p>

<p>8. Cyborg (Victor Stone) — The Living Interface

Seat: The Watchtower
Specialty: Cybernetics, data manipulation, digital warfare

Cyborg isn’t just tech — he is technology. With direct access to every network on Earth (and beyond), 
his brain processes data at machine speed while retaining human emotion.

Why he’s special: He represents the bridge between man and machine — a genius of instinct and information.
</p>

<p>
9. Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson / Nabu) — The Mystic Mind

Seat: The Tower of Fate
Specialty: Magic, ancient sciences, cosmic philosophy

Doctor Fate’s intellect extends beyond mortal comprehension fueled by ancient wisdom and divine insight. 
Nabu’s knowledge of magic, time, and existence itself places him at the edge of omniscience.

Why he’s special: He fuses intellect with spirituality — knowledge that’s both infinite and mystical.
</p>

---<p>

10. The Source — The Ultimate Mind

Seat: Beyond all things
Specialty: Creation itself

The Source is not just intelligent — it’s the origin of intellect. The consciousness that drives existence,
it’s what beings like the Monitor, Metron, and New Gods seek to understand but never fully grasp.

Why it’s special: It defines the ceiling of knowledge in the DC Universe — the mind beyond minds.


---
</p>
Final Thought

From Luthor’s ruthless genius to The Source’s omniscience, the DC Universe proves that brains can shake worlds just as much as power ever could.
 Each of these minds sees reality differently through logic, empathy, obsession, or divine understanding and together, 
 they remind us that intelligence isn’t just about answers, but about how far one dares to ask.

            <p class="article-excerpt">
            Arsenal’s 2025/26 Premier League Triumph Winning the Title by 11 Points The numbers are in  and they’re painting North London red.
            </p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>
             <p>I've got to say as a Man Utd Fan this hurts while writing but..</p>   According to Opta’s latest supercomputer forecast, Arsenal is on course to win the 2025/26 Premier League title, 
             finishing 11 points clear of the competition. The model predicts Mikel Arteta’s side will end the season with 80 points, 
             well ahead of Manchester City on 70 and Liverpool on 69. Arsenal currently lead the table with 19 points from nine unbeaten games,
              looking every bit like a team built for consistency rather than chaos. Meanwhile, defending champions Liverpool have slumped to
               seventh after losing five of their last six matches — a sharp contrast to the dominance that defined their previous campaign.

Elsewhere, Manchester United, revitalized under new manager Ruben Amorim, are projected to finish ninth on 57 points, 
despite climbing to fifth with three consecutive wins.

Opta’s simulations, which factor in team strength, form, and fixture difficulty, suggest Arsenal’s balance and momentum could finally deliver
 the title Arteta has been chasing — and this time, the data agrees with the fans’ belief.

          <p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> "The Witcher" This Season Is caught between identity and reinvention. Trying to find it's joy and magic again.</p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem">
             <p>
      <strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong> wasn’t bad — you could see he sincerely tried to carry the
      legacy Henry Cavill left behind. Though not perfect, he had some good fight scenes. Still, 
      the finesse — that “blade dancer” grace Geralt was known for — just wasn’t fully there.
      Some fights felt ordinary, lacking the fluid, lethal precision we once admired.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="review-body">
    <h2>Vesemir and the Fading Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Turns out, not only <strong>Henry Cavill</strong> left *The Witcher*, but even 
      <strong>Kim Bodnia</strong>. Sadly, the plot for this new Vesemir is a total letdown. 
      They’ve not only torn apart the alignment of fate from the books but made the oldest and most 
      experienced Witcher feel shallow. His final scene lacked any emotional depth — and honestly, 
      why kill him off like that?
    </p>

    <h2>Plot, Dialogue, and Direction</h2>
    <p>
      The plot twists and dialogues really fell off this season. Some conversations felt misplaced — 
      especially Jaskier’s, who somehow ended up with the most obvious plot armor. It took away the 
      tension and weight the earlier seasons built so well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another strange choice was introducing modern elements — substances and slang that just don’t 
      fit a supposed 13th-century fantasy world. A “cocaine-like” substance? It broke immersion 
      completely.
    </p>

    <h2>Characters and Performances</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Emhyr</strong> was good, but I didn’t feel the same fear and presence he once carried. 
      Still, I absolutely loved <strong>Ciri’s</strong> storyline (though I’m skeptical about her new 
      LGBTQ scenes). The character <strong>Leo Bonhart</strong> was phenomenal — I hated him, and that’s 
      exactly how a villain should make you feel.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="review-conclusion">
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Despite its flaws, Season 4 wasn’t terrible. It still had flashes of brilliance — mostly thanks 
      to the cast’s efforts and Ciri’s arc. But *The Witcher* has lost some of its dark magic. I really 
      hope the upcoming and final season brings back the heart, grit, and depth this series deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had the potential to rival *Game of Thrones* — and maybe, just maybe, it still can.
